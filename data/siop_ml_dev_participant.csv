10460010474,I would look into changing my vacation plans to a different week. The reason I would do this is to make this situation easier for everyone that is involved. It would be easy to set my vacation for a week before or after my colleagues vacation. That way everyone is happy in this situation.,I would work on the project little by little during those two weeks to be prepared for anything that might come up in the future. You never know what is going to happen in life or what job obligations you are going to be asked to take care of. I think its better in this situation to get the project out of the way early rather than finish it late.,I would probably still go. Just depending on how my body feels at the end of the day. A networking meeting with one of my largest clients is important regardless of who else will be there. I would want to do what is best for my career.,I would see what I could to do to improve the feedback from my manager. Your not always going to agree with what a manager says 100% of the time. It is important that I am mature while having a conversation about improvement for my work.,I would absolutely enjoy being involved in this project. I love learning new things about different countries and cultures. The more I can learn during this project the better.
10440103178,"I have always been a team player, but this would greatly depend upon what plans I had made. If I had already purchased airline tickets somewhere, or had promised to be at a family event, I would argue my point. Obviously, i would not want my stance to reflect poorly upon me, and I would not want to place my job in jeopardy. I would have to wait and see what my my boss' thoughts were and if there was an equitable solution he/she had in mind.","I would first address my concerns with my boss. Since this is a project it is likely important. I would advise my boss that while I can juggle many work tasks at once, some take precedence over others. I would wait to see how my boss responds, and this would in turn dictate my response/solution.","I would be all in. While accompaniment would be nice, I don't need a side-kick to hold me up. As this is a large client...any client for that matter, it is my duty and responsibility to attend. This is what I am paid to do.","I definitely would not be happy about this situation, but I would keep a level head. I would humbly and honestly explain to my boss why I don't agree with the feedback offering examples why. In addition, I would recount positive contributions I have made during my tenure at our company. I would listen to anything my boss has to say, and offer to correct whatever missteps she/he thinks I have made.","I would absolutely find this experience enjoyable. I would see this as a great opportunity. I love doing research, so finding out as much as I could about the country and culture would be right up my alley. I would be very excited."
10440099430,I would try to come to a compromise with my colleague.  I would want something in return if I let him take the vacation instead of me.  I would make it clear that he needs to trade something in exchange for me canceling my plans that week.,I would go to my boss and ask him if he has anything that he hasn't given to me yet.  I would also get everything I can done as fast as i can so if my boss does give me things at the last second I can easily handle whatever it is.,"I would go to the event, it's possible that if I go then my colleague will go with me.  I would just go there for a little while and if I'm not enjoying myself then I can just leave.  It would be a good idea to at least check it out.",I would pay attention and take an honest look at myself to decide whether the feedback is valid.  If I disagree than I would still make sure I am overachieving in the areas that the boss has pointed out.,I would find it enjoyable because I love learning about new cultures.  Even though I might not travel I still appreciate being taught about cultures other than my own.  It would also be cool to meet someone from another culture.
10460189074,I would explain to the supervisor why I need the vacation. I would tell the supervisor why I wanted to go on vacation. I would ask my colleague if he could take another week.,I would try to finish the project as soon as I had the free time. It would be great to work on the project and get it finished before the deadline. I would make the project an important thing to finish.,I would try to go to the meeting as it is an important client. I would also ask my colleague to reconsider if they would go. I would try to go and meet new people.,I would talk to my supervisor and try to figure out where the negative feedback is coming from. I would ask my manage to reconsider before I get my bonus taken away. If this doesn't work I might ask for a transfer.,I would find this enjoyable as I would learn new thing. I would not find this boring as it is always interesting to learn about new culture. It would be a great learning experience.
10459700329,I would tell them I will work this time if next time I can have first pick,I would let him know I have a big project and make sure i get started on my project so it is not last minute,I would try and convince them of all the networking opportunities they will have if they come,I would tell them I will take there feedback and work on it and ask for any pointers for help,I would find this fun because you can learn about a different culture and country
10460024065,"I would change my vacation plans. I never plan vacation (air travel, lodging etc) prior to having it set in stone that I will be guaranteed time off from work. I'm a flexible person, and when this exact situation has happened in the past, I always give in happily to the person who doesn't want to. I hope in the future they will remember my willingness to be flexible. I'm certain other people's plans are more important and inflexible than mine. I have few obligations that require me to have vacation during an exact time. If someone has a commitment they'd rather not miss, and I simply want time off, I don't want that person to miss thier commitment so i can be off.","I would immediately start the assigned project. Whether I finish immediately is not important, as I will have time to get it done in the next two weeks if I work on it diligently. It is too much of a risk to put off the project knowing that other things may be put on my plate, preventing me from attending to this assigned project. I don't like to have deadlines lingering over me if I don't have to, so getting a project done asap gives me peace of mind.","I would try to encourage my coworker to attend the networking event, so I know someone who is there. If the colleague decides not to go, I will still attend the event. It is perhaps even more beneficial for the colleague to not attend, as I will be more likely to reach out of my comfort zone and get to chat and network with the clients, which will improve our working relationship.","I would accept the feedback from my manager. It's tough to get negative criticism, but it can be treated as an opportunity for growth. During the discussion with my manager, I would immediately ask if we can have a follow up meeting in about a week to allow us both time to brainstorm on how to improve my performance, and think about things that may have been hindering performance in the first place.","I would find this experience extremely enjoyable. Learning about a new culture and country is fascinating to me. Learning more about Norway would allow me to have greater insight into the client's way of life, and hopefully give me a leg up on interacting with the client in the future."
10459761104,i would advised my supervisor that i also will not be attending work the week of my planned vacation. I would also suggest getting another worker to cover my days. I would not accept having to change my dates.,i would go ahead and begin working on the project right away. in an effort to utilize my time wisely i would go ahead and start the project. starting early will give time to make changes or corrections.,i would definitely be going home. the last thing i want to do after working all day is go to a work related meeting. whether my colleauge is going or not i wouldnt be going.,i would go over my supevisors head to his manager or superior. I wouldnt just accept the negative feedback. i would provide any information that i have to verify his feedback is incorrect.,i would find this experience boring. if the experience involved traveling to Switzerland that would be more interesting. but it would be interested to get paid just to do research.
10450672336,"I would ask my colleague how flexible his/her dates are if my desired dates were not flexible because of travel or something else.  The reason I would do this is because sometimes just opening the communication lines solves a lot.  If it appeared that their dates were not flexible, I would acknowledge my supervisor's request to have one of us there and my dates were not flexible, I would ask my supervisor to honor whomever made the request for vacation first.",I would get ahead of the work as much as I can knowing that this seems to be a pattern of behavior with my boss.  I would also communicate to them that I feel confident that I can do a quality job in the time allowed if nothing else gets prioritized at the same time.  I would also segment the work to make sure that each section gets completed according to the timeline.,"I would go.  If it is one of our largest clients whether mine personally because I am in a Commercial role or just the company's client in general, it is important to support our clients.  I would also talk to my colleague and remind them the importance of being at client events and ask them to rethink their decision.  The last thing on my mind would be not feeling comfortable with knowing nobody.","I would firstly ask for a much longer conversation about this.  In addition, I would ask for examples of behavior that led them to this conclusion so that it is less subjective.  I would also tell them that I disagree with their summary and give them specific examples of why I think the feedback is unfair.","I would absolutely find this enjoyable.  I think that learning new things are always important to do.  In addition, being able to learn more about different cultures and how companies outside of the U.S. think about business would help me in my career."
10446115503,I would ask my manager to meddle in the situation if I really have to take that vacation. If it is possible for me I would consider changing my vacation plans.,I would try to finish the project as soon as possible. This will give me time if my boss gives me another task closer to the deadline.,"I would not go if I have a choice. But considering the situation if I feel it is necessary for me to go, then I would attend.","I would feel sad about the situation. If genuinely think the feedback was unjustifiably negative, u would consider outside opportunities.",I would find it enjoyable because I would learn about another culture and country while doing my job.
10460085966,"this would depend on my relationship with this colleague.  if i had a good relationship with him/her i would give in and let him have the vacation time because i would not feel i was being taken advantage of.  however, if this coworker had a history of being selfish, or had been ""mean"" to me in the past, i would NOT give in.  all things being equal, i would want to keep the situation as ""calm"" as possible because i wouldn't want to find myself in controversy.  i always try and do the ""right"" thing because when i do, things seem to turn out well.  i might very well discuss this situation with my supervisor.  so it would depend on the circumstances, but i would be willing to let the colleague get his way if i felt that i was not being taken advantage of.","the fact that things are ""light"" now doesn't mean they will be light tomorrow, or next week.  all it takes is one unpredictable event and a schedule can get entirely messed up.  i am the type of person who has almost a neurotic need to get things done.  i like to divide projects up into smaller projects when they seem complicated.  i hardly ever leave things to the last minute, or even the last day.  so even though i have confidence in my ability to handle the current project, i would still be leaving myself ""wiggle room"" (flexible time) in case i need it.","it would almost certainly go to the networking meeting.  the key here is that this involves one of my ""largest clients.""  attending this meeting could wind up being very beneficial to me.  if nothing else, just being there might impress the client.  unless i had something very important on my schedule i would attend the conference.  not knowing anyone else there wouldn't bother me at all; in some ways i would prefer not knowing anyone; it's just my personality.  i have no problem with going places where i don't know anyone.","there is no doubt that i would take some type of action.  not only don't i agree with the feedback, but i believe it is not true.  also the fact that the feedback could carry negative consequences means that i really feel i would have no choice but to take some action.  i'm 62 and have learned that in almost all cases, the best situation is to remain calm.  putting my manager on the defensive won't help me.  so i would set up an appointment with him /her and, as respectfully as possible, tell him my perspective.  under no circumstances would i lose my cool.  i figure if i'm respectful i have a better chance of getting him/her to see things my way.  also if i speak up about this, the current situation might not change but he might think twice next time...perhaps give me the benefit of the doubt in the future.  as the adage goes, i don't want to ""win a battle and lose a war.""  as i said, i'm 62.  in my younger days there is a good chance that i might have handled something like this poorly because i might have acted impulsively and taken it very personally.","as with some of the other scenarios, this would depend on the circumstances.  the way things stand right now at my job i am quite bored and have too much free time.  a project like this is almost certainly something i'd jump at, assuming i DON'T have to travel.  i think it would provide me with some necessary variety in my day to day work life."
10459784598,"I would take in to account who made the request first and whether or not it would be possible for me to change my plans. If I had made the request first I would push the supervisor in to granting me the time off as requested. If not, I would concede to the coworker and attempt to reschedule.",I would work to get the project as complete as possible before the deadline in the event the boss decided to add additional tasks. I think it would be the wisest way to handle it in order to be certain everything is completed on time.,"I would attempt to talk the coworker in to going because it seems like an opportunity that shouldn't be missed. If I could not persuade the coworker, I might consider going alone, though in the end I more than likely would just go home.","I would be highly inclined to schedule a time with the manager to discuss what they perceive the problem to be, and to find out if he/she had been given some erroneous information that did not actually apply to me. I would feel quite tense and anxious, but I would make every attempt possible to find a way to rectify the situation.","I would welcome this opportunity with enthusiasm, as I personally, in real life, am determined to relocate myself to Norway permanently. This would be an excellent opportunity for doing just that. I would volunteer immediately."
10460000561,I would be upset initially because I feel as though I always get the short end of the stick at work.  I would talk to my director and ask who requested off first and why my coworker was not asked to rearrange their plans.  If I did end up agreeing to change my plans I would like to ask for additional time off or some kind of perk.,I would make sure my daily tasks are taken care of everyday.  I could go to my manager/boss and ask if they had any other work for me to complete instead of waiting for them to assign it to me.  That way I could maybe get a headstart and be on top of things.,I would try to talk my coworker into going.  I would like to go to the networking event but at the same time I would not like to go alone.  I would try to persuade them to come along that it would be fun and a huge opportunity if we went.  If that did not work I would probably end up going alone anyway because I would not want to miss the chance to network.  And I would certainly not want to turn down an invitation from such and important client.,"I would be totally upset upon receiving negative, constructive, feedback.  It would probably be a good idea for me to hear the information, take a day or two to think about things, and then come back and reopen the discussion with my manager.  I know I can have an attitude sometimes and I would like some time to collect my thoughts and calm down before speaking again.",I would love to volunteer for a project involving clients from another country.  It is convenient that I would not have to leave the country but it also would have been exciting to travel.  Maybe this experience will open some doors.  I would enjoy learning about the Norwegian culture and exchanging/comparing stories and customs about our home countries.
10462835839,"I would try to compare our two vacation weeks. If one is more expensive or harder to manage, then I would say that that person should go. Also, I would say that whoever has spent more time in the company deserves the week more.",I would dedicate a certain amount of time every day to work on the project so that I finish a few days early. This way I do not burn myself out and have a cushion in case another assignment comes up. I also ensure qualify of my work.,I would still go with or without them. This is a massive opportunity that I cannot waste. Perhaps I would try to convince my colleague to go so I would be more comfortable but I am going either way.,"I would feel angry and cheated. I would try to convince my boss to reconsider his opinion about me. If that does not work, I would go to my boss's boss and ask that he step in.","I would find this experience boring as it would involve a lot of research. Norway is not exactly a country that I find very exciting. Furthermore, the lack of travel just makes it seem pointless."
10459901781,"I would change my vacation plans to accomadate my colleague. I try to be very giving because I usually will get returns from individuals in future situations that are to my advantage when I ""give in"" and accommodate coworkers. I think it is nice to do because vacation time off of work is so precious and much needed. If you help others they usually help you back in the future. I would want to be a helpful employee that collaborates well with others in my group at work.","I would not procrastinate on getting this project done because of the past behavior of my boss, giving me work at the last minute to get done and still expecting me to meet all deadlines. If I am not rushed though, I can do a superb job on my assignment, so another good reason to get right on the assignment. I would hope to get the majority of the project done a week ahead, and then go back and thoroughly review all decision making and all work to make sure that no mistakes were made.","I would decide to go to this meeting because the networking advantage with one of  my largest client would dictate to me the importance of me attending, even if I must go alone. My colleague would be appreciative of any information that I find out about this important client also. I would help myself, my company, including my colleague to go to this important networking meeting to further bond my relationship with one of my largest clients.","I  would be mad and hurt at first. I would then review what the manager said to me. If I felt comfortable with the manager, I would ask for an improvement plan and any tips that would advance my knowledge concerning my lack of abilities that he/she, the manager, expects of me. I would request training, if available, to help me improve my skills.","I would find this project extremely enjoyable and would volunteer to be involved. I know almost nothing about Norway so this project would help me become informed about this country and the people that live and work in that country. I feel that my new future knowledge would also help me be more sensitive to the needs of my client from Norway, so I can be more accommodating to this client as our business relationship proceeds."
10459819347,"I would check to see who requested the vacation week first. If I were the first one to send the request, then I would let my supervisor and colleague know that I've made plans already and that my time off has already been submitted/approved. If I were the second one to submit the request, then I would be happy to take vacation during another week.","I would work on the project as much as I can as soon as possible and not wait last minute to finish it. Because my workload is light, I would have time to prioritize the project first. I would have time to do last minute tasks closer to the project deadline because I would have finished a lot of the project already.",I would go to the network meeting even if my colleague does not attend. I'm comfortable attending meetings and events by myself even if I don't know anyone. It would be a good time to touch base with one of my largest clients and also to meet new people.,I would set up a meeting with my manager and HR to discuss my perspective and why I don't think the negative feedback portrays my work. I have had to do this in the past so I would be comfortable sharing my viewpoint. I would share specific accomplishments I've completed and argue each of my manager's feedback points.,I would find this experience enjoyable and would definitely volunteer to work on this project. I like learning about different cultures and would visit the client if I could. I embrace other countries and cultures and I don't need walls to keep me safe from the unknown.
10460284914,"I would give him the vacation time providing that he cover three shifts in the near future. I believe this would be beneficial for myself and him. He gets the early vacation time, while I get three extra days off. I think that's the only way I would give up the time to him.","I would immediately finish the project. The work load is light, so I would work on the project during down time to make things more efficient. This way if my boss drops unexpected work I won't be set back. I'd rather do that then try to ask him not to give me more work as the dead line gets closer.",I'd still go if the colleague decided not to go. I would use the meeting as an opportunity to make myself look good. In addition to that gain some valuable insight on the inner workings of the higher ups. I'd also use this as a good learning experience to move up the corporate ladder.,I'd personally argue the feedback. I would ask him for specific instances of the feed back to make sure that this isn't a bias on his part. In addition to that I would be able to provide counter arguments that support my work. I'd let him know that this is for my lively hood and I am not willing to take feedback unless it is based on factual evidence.,I'd find the experience boring. I don't have any interest in learning anything that doesn't bring some sort of excitement to the table. This task in particular sounds mundane and boring. I would not volunteer for it for free.
10462839939,I would talk directly with the co-worker to see if we can make any changes to our plans. I would base my willingness to have this conversation based on how well we get along. I would also want to know if wither of our plans included a trip that had importance such as already being booked or for a special occasion.,"I would work on this project regularly. I would get a lot done before it was due. Based on my boss's past work history, I would not wait until the last minute to get the work done.",I would go to the event. Even without my coworker it is a good chance to make new connections. I would be outgoing and get my name out there.,I would request a meeting with my boss. I would also want another supervisor (such as theirs) at the meeting. I want to know the basis of the review.,I would find this both boring and exciting. I would rather do research than travel. I likely would do the research so in the future I might not have to travel.
10446139949,"I would be willing to change my plans if I could, but if we both couldn't change, then I'm not sure what the next step would be. If I could and did change plans, I would do so letting my colleague know that in the future it would be on him or her to change plans or I would get first choice on vacation weeks or something. I would be perturbed by my colleague, but as long as I could change my vacation week I could. Otherwise I would go to the colleague with my boss and we would have to come up with a fair way to decide who got that week of vacation.","I would work really hard to get it done. I'd put in the extra work and do it, though I might be unhappy at times. Still I'd try to stay optimistic about it and do my best given the time that I have.","I would go because it is a good opportunity to improve my standing with the client. I would also look good to my bosses. It wouldn't matter to me that my colleague was not going. I would suck it up and go, even if I did not want to.","I would feel really crappy about the whole situation. I would probably want more information about the feedback, and approach my boss about it. I would try to get the feedback removed from my record or whatnot so it couldn't impact my bonus. I might appeal the feedback to someone at a higher level or file a report on my boss if it was really unfair.","I would find it enjoyable, but boring at the same time. It would be nice to learn about a new culture, but more fun if travel was definitely a part of it. I would try to be optimistic about the situation and enjoy it, but it would be extra work. It might be a little boring in that way."
10459663664,I would allow let her/him have it but they would have to do a favor for me in the future. I think it would be a good trade-off.,I would start on the project right away if my boss was like that. I don't like the stress of handling multiple projects. I feel it's a good idea to just get over it right away.,"I would just go anyways, especially if the meeting ids beneficial. I would go independently if the situation didn't involve a co-worker. I have no problem attending functions by myself.",I would probably just deal with the situation. I would really like my bonus so i don't want to jeopardize it. It depends on how untruthful it was. If it was very untruthful I might voice my opinion nicely and move on with my work.,I would find it enjoyable because I like learning about other cultures. Maybe in the future if I do a really good job with this project I would be able to travel there. I think that is exciting and fun.
10460214167,I would change my plan because it is only choice I would have as my supervisor would not let us take the vacation at the same week and my colleague is not willing to change their vacation plan. I would have to explain to my husband about this situation and discuss more about adjusting our vacation plan. I would ask my colleague that this time I would adjust my plan but next time I am not willing to change my vacation for them as I think they should not expect me to do them favors every time.,I would work and try to finish the project as soon as I could so that I would not be worried about it later in case I get last minutes tasks from my boss. I would make sure I have it done before the due date so that I would not feel bad. I would be afraid of not be able to submit it in time if I would handle it right away. I would make sure to finish it as soon as I have a chance.,I would convince my colleague to go with me because it will be good for them to meet one of my largest clients. I would tell them it is a good opportunity for them to make a connection with one of my largest clients. I would tell them they could have a good chance for their work and businesses. I would tell them I will introduce them to one of my largest clients and it is not easy chance for anyone.,"I would feel very bad. I would ask manager nicely to clarify and explain what really happened on my view and what the best solution at that time. I would tell my manager that my decision based on company's benefits and if I did not decide that, it would have negative consequences for our company later. I would ask my manager what the best solution my manager would think of and I would say that I will keep it in my mind. I would say that I will do better next time as I have learnt this experiences.",I would find this experience enjoyable because I would learn somethings new about the country. I would enjoy to learn Norway's culture and I would open my mind to know more about them. I would enjoy to learn from others and would have new friends from learning new country. I would have fun to learn new things and it would help my work and my job as well.
10459943758,"I would approach the supervisor verbally. I'd inform them that I don't mind rescheduling my vacation plans. However, I need to confirm immediately that it would be approved prior to rescheduling. My relationship with my colleague would not be effected at all. I would understand that as an employee, these things happen. In this situation, a follow up email to my supervisor and cc my fellow team-members. In the email, I would include the dates that I am requesting off, and confirm each one via an email response that are able to be at work those days I'm requesting off. If no response within 2 days of my email, I'd follow up verbally with each team member who didn't reply and ask them politely to respond. This way, there are no questions asked later and no confusion.",I would focus solely on this project in my free-time or when my work load is seemingly light. I'd ask my supervisor in advance if there are any immediate tasks she needs completed prior to me starting on the project.,"In this scenario, I would strongly benefit by going to this meeting without my colleague. My colleague won't have the benefit of getting to know the client. The client won't be able to know my colleague. Thus, I'd be given the genuine opportunity to prove to my client how important they are. My colleague won't be able to make or break my future.","Via email, I'd politely confront my manager. I'd be prepared to prove to them, I don't deserve the negative feedback as well as feed them with all of my excellent qualities.Id then request for a new or revised review.","My nationality is part Norwegian. I always enjoy learning. Especially, about a different culture. This would be an extremely excellent opportunity to think out of the box and think of the prospective possibilities I could benefit from this project. I'm in & ready to enjoy!"
10462876988,"I would be willing to change my vacation if the dates were avaliable. I think it's petty to hold out. Not to mention in order to be the bigger person, it may be more appealing to your supervisor.",I would go ahead and start the project. Not necessarily finish but start. That way if something comes up during the two weeks that is more time consuming I wont have to rush as much at the deadline.,I would still go to the meeting. It makes for an opportunity to network and it may actually influence my colleague to go as well. Peer pressure them into reverse psychology.,The situation would make me very uncomfortable. I would try and talk to my manager if they were the type to not take everything as a threat. If they had a boss possibly contact them as an alternative.,I would probably find the experience boring. Without traveling there is nothing really new to see or experience. It would be a lot of internet research.
10440106826,"I guess it would depend on if I had reservations somewhere and I couldn't change my plans. I would talk with the other worker and see if we could come up with a solution together. If not, I would probably be the one to change.","Even though I fee I can do the project easily, I would get started on it right away. I am a person who does not put things off. Since the boss occasionally gives out longer projects in that same time frame, I would definitely start right away.","I would probably go alone, although I would feel out place. I would feel this is important to my job and I need to be there. Maybe I could meet some interesting people.","I would set up a meeting with the manager to talk about it. I would state my case and see what his position is all about. In doing so, I believe we could come to an understanding.",I would totally find this enjoyable. I like learning about other places. I think it would also give me an opportunity to help out with this client.
10459694726,I would change my vacation time. It's most likely that I haven't made very specific weekly plans. So i'll be able to take the time off whenever,I would focus on it first and foremost. Things with quick deadlines need to be knocked out fast. If the boss provides something that is needed sooner there's no reason not to get it out of the way.,I would try to convince to colleague to go. It would be good for both of us to go and I wouldn't want to go alone. If I couldn't get him I'd consider it based on my other plans for the night.,I would try to get any solid proof that it wasn't true. If some kind of actual consequence happened hopefully the evidence I have would help me. I wouldn't press it though.,"I would find it enjoyable as there's some of my heritage in the Scandinavian countries. I also like learning about new and exiting things, cultures at the forefront."
10459917778,"I would either go to my boss and explain why I needed to take vacation that week or I would talk to my coworker and see why they had to take vacation that week. It really depends on what my vacation plans are and how flexible they are. If I already had a trip booked and it was difficult or expensive to change, I would go to my boss and coworker and lay it out for them.","I would complete my work well ahead of time. Since my boss is known for giving tasks at the last minute, I wouldn't want to procrastinate and then be given these tasks. It's much less stressful for me to have things completed well ahead of their due dates.","I would talk to my coworker and see why they don't want to go. I don't like going to networking events in general so I would try my best to talk them into going. If they didn't, then I would probably attend, but for a short time.","I would be incredibly upset and refuse to sign any paperwork associated with the feedback, if applicable. I would meet with my boss to talk about it and explain my side of the situation. If necessary, I would also go to HR.",I would absolutely love it. Even if I didn't get to travel to Norway. I love learning about other places and cultures and this sort of thing is my forte.
10460085519,"I would ask to have a meeting with my supervisor and I would ask my colleague to be present. Then, I would ask my supervisor to tell us who asked for days off first. If it is me than I  have to go on vacation. If that is not the case then my colleague can go. I would do this because I think it is a fair solution.","I  would try to finish the project as soon as possible, at least a week before the due date because I will have enough time to carefully go through it and check for any mistakes. Then I would present the final version of the project to my boss for revision. I would do this because if my boss asks for any changes I would be able to do it without breaking the due date.","I would do anything to pursue my colleague to go with me. I would explain to him that this is our opportunity to meet new and important clients and that could be a good way to get noticed. I would do this because I think this can be a good way to get a promotion and build a strong social network in our work environment. At the end, I like having company when I need to join the group I hardly know.","I would feel very concerned. I would ask for a meeting with my manager. I would try to prepare all my file and projects I have been working on that year, especially the successful ones. I would present them at the meeting with my manager and explain to him that I take my job very seriously and that I would like to show my good will to do even more. I would even suggest taking some additional training or course that can make me more efficient. I would do this because I want to keep my job, maintain a good reputation and receive a bonus.","I would be glad to accept to volunteer and work on this project. It would be a very enjoyable experience because it is an opportunity to learn something new and different. It would be a good way to present myself to an international client and work on the international project. Secretly, I would hope to travel to Norway  what would make this work even more exciting"
10462854256,"I guess it would depend on what my vacation plans were for. Most of the time I don't request vacation for an actual vacation, I'm taking it for an important reason. If my coworker really needed the week off and I didn't I'd just let them have it, if I had something really important to do and they refused to change their plans I'd take it to my supervisor.",I'd get the project done early. If my boss might spring something on me later it would be better for me to just get it done now. I'd finish my light workload for the day and spend the rest of my time finishing the project.,"I'd still go. Networking is important, its about meeting people and making connections. If they don't want to go that's their problem but I'm going to take advantage of the situation.",I'd be upset first of all. I would ask to speak with my manager regarding their decision so that maybe I could understand their point of view better. It would also give me the opportunity to argue my case and possibly avoid those unwanted consequences.,"I'd find it kind of boring. I don't really care about Norway, and if I wasn't going to travel there it wouldn't benefit me personally. I'd probably still do it just because it would make me look good but I wouldn't find the experience that enjoyable."
10440133625,"I would take the higher road, and select the different week of vacation.  I typically do not travel for vacation, so changing my vacation days isn't a big deal to me.  I'd then notify my family of the changed dates and continue my day as normal.","I would begin work on this project immediately.  Due to my boss' tendencies, I would anticipate any last second delays to avoid missing my deadline.  This would alleviate any pressure from a last second tasking.","I would check my schedule and see if I had time available the same day.  If I have time available, I'd volunteer to attend.  If not, I would not attend, but the opportunity missed would be noted.","I would immediately put together supporting evidence showcasing my work ethic.  I would then schedule a separate time to discuss with my supervisor for a follow-up to the original meeting.  Once proven to be incorrect, the supervisor would hopefully reverse his decision.","I would find this experience to be rewarding because I'm always fascinated by international clients.  I'd take this opportunity to learn as much about my new clients, as possible.  Hopefully I would be given the chance to travel, but it wouldn't be the end of the world if the opportunity never materialized."
10459943941,I would try and convince the worker even more to let me have my vacation. I would even offer to take some of their hours when I come back and they can have an extra day or two vacation time. I would be angry and upset if nothing I did worked.,I would focus on the task entirely. I would try and talk to my boss and let them know what this project means to me. I would try and tell my boss not to overload with me last minute tasks if possible.,"I would try and ask the colleague to come with and what it could mean for our business. If the colleague didn't want to go and absolutely didn't want to go, I would go alone. I would handle it by myself and make connections.",I would try and prove to my manager how my performance is. I would try and work harder throughout to prove myself. I would discuss with the boss about what I can also change to improve my performance to how it satisfies them.,I would find this experience enjoyable. I would be pleased to work with a person from a different country and get a different perspective on things. I would like to help the person learn things because I could learn things as well and it could be exciting and new experience.
10462975391,I would talk to the colleague and try to work out a deal. I think it would be fair to agree to have some bargaining to possibly have weekends or other days covered by the colleague if that was allowed. I would probably try to get my vacation first before making a deal.,I would start by getting as much done in the first few days. My ideal goal would be to be almost done after the first week. During the second week I would fine tune the project and make sure it was up to standard. This would allow me to be able to deal with the last minute tasks.,I would try and convince my colleague to go. I would offer to make it up to them and do favors for him or her in the future. If they decide not to go I would go alone and do my best to meet new people.,I would take a look at the feedback and feel really frustrated. I know this because I have had bad feedback before and I didn't like it because I try really hard. I would take it seriously however and do what I can to improve on my work.,I would find it to be very enjoyable. It's not often I get to travel especially overseas. I would certainly take it as an opportunity and do whatever I can to learn about Norway and hopefully meet some new people. I think I would also really like what food Norway will have to offer. Even if I don't get the opportunity to visit I think it would be a good experience.
10459910058,"I would be reasonable.  If my colleague had booked airfare and I hadn't, I would change my request.  If it was the other way around, I would expect the same courtesy.","I would let my boss know that I am willing to help on the project, but that means I would be occupied until the project was complete.  By giving my boss the heads up, it s a subtle way fo saying, don't expect to be able to dump last minute things on me while I am helping on this project.","I would go anyway.  Even if I don't know anyone, the idea would be to meet as many people as possible.  I would not expect to go to a networking event and spend time with a colleague.",I would be sure that I explained my feelings to my manager and ask for very specific instances of the negative behavior.  I would make a point to let him know I will not lay down and accept non-tangible feedback.,I would like this opportunity very much.  I am naturally curious about other cultures and places and this would give me the chance to explore Norway's cultural differences.  I would also be interested in traveling there should the opportunity come up.
10459660058,"I would talk to the colleague about their plans and let them know that I would move my vacation.  I would do this for several reasons.  First, it sounds like they are pretty set on taking their vacation that specific week and I typically schedule pretty flexible vacations.  Additionally, this would build trust with that coworker and may result in a better work environment.  Finally, it would show my manager that I am flexible and and team player.",I would talk to my manager and try to get any information about possible changes that I could.  This would help cut down on the last minute work.  I would also deal with any last minute work that did come up by working additional hours.  This would show my work ethic.,I would probably not go either since I wouldn't be my best self and it seems that my colleague would rather not go either.  It seems that we would have a reasonable excuse for anyone that asked.  I think in my colleague would appreciate me not going so he didn't feel required to go.,I would bring it up with him that I wasn't happy with the result.  I believe communication is key in situations like this.  Since there could be negative consequences I would likely take it up the chain if my manager didn't budge.,I would find this experience very enjoyable.  I really enjoy learning new things and working with new people. I also like that there would be some chance of travel but not like I would need to move there.
10440148040,I am usually very good about trying to accommodate my co-workers and clients. i would do my best to take the week my co-worker would not budge on. I like things calm at work so i would do whatever I could to take the week my co=worker did not want.,I would take my best guess at what my boss would throw at me last minute and prepare accordingly. I would juggle my schedule professional and private to make room for the work my boss might give me. I would gather anything that might be beneficial would these last minute tasks so i would be prepared.,I would go even though I am an introvert and rather shy. I would first try to bribe my co-worker with any means necessary but if they refused I would go because that kind of opportunity does not come along very often.,At most companies there is a way to file a grievance if you have an issue with management. To file a grievance to dispute the negative feedback usually mean following a certain protocol and filling out forms.  I would be very upset but I would address each issue of the negative feedback and write down specifically why I feel my boss is in the wrong. i would then talk to the appropriate dept about filing the grievance.,I would love to be involved in this project and i would be first to volunteer. i love to learn about different cultures and it might also score brownie points with my boss if i did really well on this project. This is the kind of project I enjoy and excel at.
10460029573,"It depends on the vacation plans of the other person versus me. Were they made very far in advance? I suppose I could reschedule my vacation, but if the week of my vacation is important (like visiting my girlfriend out of state or something intensely important) I'd be firm in my decision to go on vacation.","I'd just do my best. My boss is my boss, and he/she should be aware the small tasks I'm being required to do are going to take up additional time. If I couldn't meet the deadline because of the additional assignments, I'm not concerned, because I did the best I could.","This question is a bit confusing to me because I was invited, so someone there knows me. I'd meet up with that person and then take it from there. It's business.","I'd feel like shit about it, but there is nothing I could do. I'd just try harder leading up to my next evaluation to make up for my performance. Nothing to sweat. Work isn't life.","I'd probably find it interesting. I like Norway. I've never been there. As long as I don't have to learn the language, I'll be fine!"
10459683378,"I would tell my boss that since I had put in my vacation request first, then it is only fair that I be allowed to take the week of vacation off. I would make sure that all of my communication went through my boss. I would not engage this coworker directly to solve the problem, but would rely on my manager to make a decision.","I would try and finish as much of the project as possible while I had some down time. To mitigate last-minute asks, I would schedule regular meetings with my boss 3-4x per week to check in. If something last minute came up, I would try and leverage other team members to finish it in a timely manner.","I would likely skip the networking meeting. I would have found the long day at work to be exhausting and it would be difficult for me to have the stamina for another professional event where I had to be ""on"". I would try and set up a smaller lunch with the client.",I would ask my boss where she got the impression that my work was subpar. I would give her specific examples of when I had performed well. I would give her a list of colleagues she could talk to who could vouch for my work.,"I would find this experience extremely enjoyable. It would be an opportunity to learn more about a new culture. It would also be a good opportunity to get more face-time with the client, which could lead to professional benefits down the road."
10460015614,I would ask my supervisor to look into which of us was the first to ask.  Afterwards I would imply that who ever asked first should get the vacation days off and the other has to say and work.  Then I would suggest that the the one who has to work gets the following week off.,I would try and and get as much done as possible before the possibility of a last minute task occurs then I would have enough time to tackle both and not be overly stressed. given that my work load is light I should have enough time to finish it earlier. then I would likely not be hot with and over abundance of work to do last minute.,I would suggest that they come with me. I would make a deal with them that I would do something for them in return. like buying lunch or something to that nature. And if not then I would go alone and try and make the best of it and impress my clients as well as possible.,I would confront my boss about the situation and have them correct it. because if the negative feedback wasn't warranted then it wouldn't be given. if the situation doesn't change then I would search for a new job.,I would find this experience very enjoyable. given the fact that I am highly interested in visiting Norway in the future. I am very interested in travel and that experience would be great in the future if I was to ever visit there.
10459825415,"Since my coworker is not willig to and we both can't go at the same time, I change my week. Because it doesn't make any sense to fight over it. And one of us has to be there. I'm a flexible person.","I would complete the project early. Since my boss is apt to give me last minute projects, I would have it completed. If I still had a light workload, I would just enjoy it.","Since this is my biggest client, I would go. I wouldn't stay long because of the long day at work and not knowing anyoe there.",I feel awful. I would go to the next higher up and explain to him/her what is going on to see if I could gain some understanding.,"I would find this experience enjoyable. I would be delighted to study and research another country without travel, while still in my country. I think it would be fun."
10459781559,"I would change my vacation plans and take a different week. I would let my colleague know that they owed me one. Not that I would enjoy having someone indebted to me, but I believe in fairness. I myself would be inconvenienced but knowing that my supervisor would be grateful to me for not making the situation more dramatic would make things easier.",I would complete the project ahead of time. This will give me some leeway in case my boss has any last minute changes to the project. It will allow me to review my work for any errors. I would also be free to work on any other tasks.,"I would talk with my colleague and convince them that they should attend the networking meeting with me. That together we would meet new people and be able to share our experiences. Also, that we would learn more about our client and their business needs. I would again express my enthusiasm and desire to attend the meeting with my colleague, convincing them that it would be a fun and eventful experience.","I would calmly confront my manager and request that they explain their evidence and reasons for the negative feedback. I would calmly and politely express my disappointment regarding the negative feedback. I would explain that if any improvement on my end were to happen, I would need the details of where I possibly went wrong. I would do everything in my nature to remedy the situation until both my manager and myself were satisfied.","I would be the first to volunteer, believing that it would be an exciting and enjoyable experience. Meeting people from different countries has always been interesting to me. It is always fun to compare the differences between culture and customs. I would spend most of my free time researching Norway, so that when I did talk to the client, I would understand any of their native references."
10446120539,I would be willing to change my vacation plans. I would do this because I want to be a good employee and co-worker. I would also ask my co-worker if he/she would be willing to trade vacation dates the following time to make sure this type of situation does not happen again.,I would do everything I could to get the project done early. I would expect to have to do some last minute fixes to make sure the project is perfect. I would also be ready for any interruptions that could come my way and allow for extra time while I would be completing the project in case those interruptions happened.,"I would still attend the networking meeting without my colleague. I am good at mixing with people. I am also good at getting to know people I have not met before. At first, it could be awkward, but I would be able to make my way through it. This meeting would also allow me to improve the company's relationship with this client.","I would be extremely frustrated by this situation for two reasons. First, I would be frustrated that I did not do well. Second, I would be frustrated because I could lose my annual bonus. I would talk to my manager about getting another chance. I would also ask how I could improve, so I could do better next time.",I would find this experience enjoyable. I like learning things about different cultures and people. I would be willing to do everything I could to learn as much as possible. This would widen my worldview and make me a better person and employee.
10440130868,"I would be willing to change my vacation plans.  I understand that in life, stuff happens.  Sometimes we have to be flexible and usually when we are, good things happen.  I'm always willing to help out and I never plan things that cannot be changed due to this.","I would start working on it immediately.  I wouldn't want to take the risk of getting a new project and having too much to handle.  If I got right to work and handled the roughest parts of the project first, it would make it easier on me in the long run if I have to pick up any other assignments.","I would definitely go to the networking meeting.  While it would be awkward to not know anyone there, I would be gaining knowledge and contacts that could help move my career forward.  I would not want to waste such an opportunity just because someone else doesn't want to attend.",I would feel really upset about this situation.  I don't appreciate it when people mess with my money.  I would go to whoever is above my supervisor and explain the situation.  Then I would ask for them to evaluate my work and decide if my manager's feedback is accurate.,"I would find this experience very enjoyable.  I like to challenge myself and I think that learning about a new culture would be very challenging.  It would give me an opportunity to learn and grow, which in turn benefits me.  I would also find it interesting and I love tasks that have something new and interesting about them."
10440118374,"I would approach the supervisor and ask him to make the ultimate decision. I think it should be up to him, and my colleague and I need to abide by whatever decision he makes. If he makes a decision that I need to change my plans, I would be happy to do so.","I would not waste the time that I have. I would get to work on this right away. I would not want to wait to the last minute, especially if there’s a chance that I might get more assignments before it’s due.","It might be a little uncomfortable, but I would go. I would not care if my colleague went or not. I would need to go so that I can get to know this large client better, and experience some networking.","I would to start the process of challenging his opinions. I would follow the procedures laid out in the policy handbook about how to disagree with evaluations. I believe it after following the steps, I will be vindicated.","I would like to take on this responsibility. This would be a very interesting experience to learn about another country. Even though I wouldn’t be able to travel for it, it would still be valuable."
10459850916,I would change my vacation plans because I would want to be stress free during my time off.I would give my colleague the week.I wouldnt want to worry about coming back to work with a potential conflict to deal with.I am flexible with my planning and rarely make reservations anyways,I would complete the project.If I am prepared for the boss extra tasks it will eliminate last minute stress which is crucial to me.I would have better piece of mind knowing that I am prepared,I would attend the meeting.This would give me a chance to network by myself.I would be forced to associate with the strangers and make new contacts if i went alone.,I would be very upset and prepared to defend myself.I would study the details of the situation and confront the manager.If I would discuss the details and try and resolve this issue.,I would find this experience very enjoyable.I have always been interested in other cultures.I would use this as an opportunity to learn.
10446129596,I would change my plans. My vacations don't involve registration to things in advance I can not cancel so it's not that terrible of a hassle to change it. I wouldn't want to upset my colleague by ruining any of their plans.,I would work quickly and efficiently. As it could take a significant amount of time I would not dillydally or waste time. Things would be done early on if possible.,I would try to persuade them to come along. If they don't come with it'll be more awkward being there alone. I would have more confidence if they were there.,I would speak to my superiors about the situation explaining my side. Over some time there would be evidence to suggest I was unfairly negatively targeted and I would bring this evidence up. I would be very upset about this.,I would find this very enjoyable. Leaning new things about a different country is fascinating and exciting. Learning new things about a different culture even more so.
10440118779,"I would see if my plans were flexible. If they are flexible, I would volunteer to change vacation weeks. If my plans were not flexible, I would explain to my boss why I could not change weeks.","I would focus on completing the project ahead of schedule. If my workload is light, then I should be able to put additional energy into the project. Completing the project ahead of schedule takes the pressure off in the event I do receive last minute assignments.","I would consider whether or not I am expected to attend this event. If it is an event where I am expected to represent my company, and I am expected to be there, then I would go. If I can legitimately get out of it, however, I would skip it.","I would try to figure out why my manager believes the negative feedback to be true. I would ask for specific examples.  I would also provide specific examples of how I believe I have done a good job, and trust that I can either learn from the experience, or change my manager's mind.",I would find the experience enjoyable. I like to learn about other countries and cultures. I would also have a secret hope that if I did a really good job I might be able to travel.
10460048704,"I would allow my coworker to take their preferred vacation time. However, I would have a talk with my coworker and ask for a small favor in return. Perhaps asking if they would cover me for my vacation week.","I would ask my boss in advance if he was preparing to assign me a project. Then, I would attempt to complete my assignments as quickly and clearly as possible. I would try to have faith in my abilities.",I would ask my colleague about the specifics of their plan. I would also let them know the specifics that I would not know anybody there and that it would mean a great deal to me should they decide to come with. I do dearly hope they would decide in my favor.,"I would take the concerns my manager gave me seriously, despite not agreeing with it. I would also ask my manager what they would prefer I do with their knowledge of what they said. I would take precautions to watch myself more closely at work.",I would find this experience quite enjoyable. The reason for this being that I very much love to learn new things. I would find it quite interesting and would suggest for myself to be involved in the project.
10460091047,"I would take a different week if I didn't have set plans. It really depends on why I need the time off. However, I am willing to be a team player.",I would get the project done as soon as possible. I don't like to have things hanging over my head. I would rather be safe than sorry.,I would go even if my colleague didn't go. I would want to do what is best for my company.

I would want to make things better.,I would find this experience enjoyable. I like to learn new things. I especially like to learn about other countries.
10459669406,I would tell my supervisor that my colleague can have that week off and would take a different week later. This is because my plans were something that I could reschedule at a different date. I would then let my colleague know what occurred.,I would make sure to get as much of the project done before the deadline in two weeks. This way if my boss threw any last minute tasks at me I would not have to worry about the project. I instead would have already done most or all of it ahead of time.,I would try to persuade my colleague to come by telling him that despite our long day this might be a once in a lifetime opportunity. I would tell him that having connections with people and who you know are the major factor that can help advance careers. We might meet someone at this meeting that could help benefit our careers down the line.,"I would not argue with my manager about the situation, as doing so might only lead to more negative feedback. Instead, I would do everything I can to show by example that the feedback could not simply be true. Hopefully, this would get my manager to rescind the negative feedback.","I would volunteer to be involved in the project because it would show the company that I am someone who is willing to go above and beyond. I would also find this experience enjoyable because I love learning about new cultures. Plus, learning more about Norway would be interesting in general."
10440099664,"I would make another appeal to my supervisor. I would bring him/her ideas on how to cover with both of us being out for the week. If that fails, and knowing my coworker is inflexible, I would have to take a different week. I wouldn't be happy about it, but such is life.",I would start the project now and not procrastinate. This would allow me to not feel rushed should something else pop up. I have learned from past experience that it's never good to wait. I will produce a better final product regardless of any extra work that I might get.,"I would go regardless of the fact that my coworker isn't. Having a career and being serious about it isn't dependent on what those around me do or do not do. I haven't gotten this far in life by only being in comfortable situations. Even though I will be uncomfortable, the networking could open up some doors and put me ahead a bit.","I would gather my thoughts and composure while I made of draft of my points. As I went over it to make it more concise, I would make sure that I left emotion and pride out of it. When I had a concise and professional rebuttal, I would request to sit down with my manager again, or his manager, and go over the things that I disagreed with and why. Ultimately, I may make no difference and be no happier, but at least I will have intelligently and respectfully approached it instead of doing nothing.","I would absolutely volunteer. The opportunity would definitely gain me cred at work and help in achieving my goals. I would find it extremely enjoyable. It would not only break up the normal monotony of my job, but I would find it all really interesting."
10460028457,"I would change my plans if at all possible to accomodate the supervisor's request.  It is right to accomodate the supervisor, provided you wish to keep your job.","I would start on the project as soon as possible in my down time.  I do not like to wait until the last minute to do anything, especially when i know the boss could well toss something to me at the last minute that would keep me from finishing the special project.","I would go because it wouldn't be right for our company to not be represented, even if i were the only person there & did not know anyone else there. It doesn't really matter what my colleague decides to do -- that is on him -- it is up to me & what i decide to do that dictates my job performance.","i would most likely ask for some time to speak with my manager in private at a time when it was quiet & convenient for him & i both. At that time, i would ask why he felt the way he did & upon hearing him out, i would point out to him why i felt he was wrong & did not feel the negative feedback was true.  I would be honest, open & polite.","I would probably like to volunteer to be involved in the project as i like to learn new things.  Learning about a new country & a new culture would be facinating, not boring , to me & the fact that i would not have to travel would also be a plus to me.  I think it would be something different & that is always intriguing."
10440103141,"As far as company vacations are concerned, I think it should be ""the first to schedule it gets it,"" but I'd probably talk to my colleague and try to find out why that particular week is so important to him/her.  It s/he is going somewhere for a wedding, an anniversary, or some other special occasion that can't be postponed, I'd probably let him/her take that week off and postpone my own plans.  I don't have any family anymore, so I'm fairly flexible.","I wouldn't wait until the last minute to start working on the project, I'd dive into it right away.  And I'd get my boss involved in it by talking to him/her about my progress on it every day.  I'd also ask for advice, even if I didn't need it, just to get the boss more interested in it and take some ownership in it instead of being totally detached from it.","I would go to the meeting by myself because I think it's important.  I don't mind going to meetings alone.  And I love networking, so I'd meet as many people as possible and look for common ground with all of them.","I'd listen to my manager and try to understand his/her point of view, then subtly start trying to change his/her opinion.  (I'm really good at that.  And I know how to do it in such a way that the other person thinks that they saw the light all by themselves, even though I was the one who was holding the flashlight the whole time.)","I would find the experience enjoyable.  I've been to Scandinavia and even studied Scandinavian languages, so I wouldn't be starting from scratch.  And I wouldn't mind if the project involved traveling to Norway because I love to travel.  Norway is a beautiful country."
10440113634,I would try to get the time off by persuading my supervisor if I was the one who placed the vacation request first. I should rightfully get the time off ahead of them if that was the case. If they requested the time before me then I would accept the reality or the situation and do my best to plan ahead better the next time. I would want to avoid conflict in any way to avoid issues at work.,I would do my best to complete the current task as fast and efficiently as possible. I would want to be prepared to the potential late project from my boss. I would not take it easy because I wouldn't want to lull myself into a false sense of security. I would want to be as prepared as possible to avoid a potential failure.,I would go anyway. I think it's important to network with the client. I would also try my best to convince my colleague to join me because it would be beneficial to both of us. I would stress the importance to them so they will go with me and make things less awkward.,I would feel frustrated and uncomfortable. I would feel helpless and angry that I couldn't convince them that they were wrong. I would do my best to calmly explain my point of view and use as much evidence as I could to point out why my perspective was correct. I would do whatever I could to persuade them without seeming insulting.,I would find it boring because I am not that interested in Norway. I don't think it's a very interesting country or culture. I don't like learning about things when I'm being tasked with doing so. I prefer learning on my own about things that I decide I am naturally curious about otherwise I get bored.
10460090916,"I would try to see if a compromise could be reached. Depending on what was planned, I maybe able to change my plans. I would also look into telecommuting.","I would do as much as possible as early as possible to get it done. as things get closer to the due date, I would keep a tight schedule so I could have more flexibility.",I would go. It would be a good opportunity to go outside my usual self and get to know different people. It would work out for the better.,"I would check in with someone I know to verify what my manager said. It would help to get more information. If I am wrong, then I could alter my actions.",I would like it. I do enjoy learning about other cultures. I believe most cultures have something about them that is interesting.
10459864349,"I would probably try to rearrange my vacation.  It would, of course, depend on the plans I already have in place.  If I'm am able I would make plans for a different week.  I figure that I would be seen as accommodating and helpful, maybe this would serve me down the line in term of having favors to call in, or being considered for promotions.  I typically don't do things to rock the boat, calling out sick for that time would not be an option, or insisting that I keep the time I had booked.","I would try to get the project done ahead of time, and if I don't get any last minute assignments from my boss I'd try to make this project as good as possible.  I hate being in a rushed situation, and I would be upset with myself if I handed in an incomplete project due to a lack of time or conflicting commitments.  I always want to impress those that have influence over me.","I would make every effort to go.  Even if I know nobody I'd at least like to show my face.  Were I not to go I'd be second guessing the possible outcomes from having been there, I'd feel like I'd let myself down.  This is a chance to get ahead, networking can pay off exponentially more than good work, if done right.  If nothing comes of it what is the harm.",I would feel irritated and annoyed.  I would stew for the rest of the day and think about what options I have.  Usually I would make up my mind to reassert my feeling on the subject with my boss.  Once my initially reactions have faded I would double down on my work to prove my worth and try to put the incident behind me.,"I would like to do this, even more so if the travel was involved.  I like discovering new countries and cultures, and I'd like the novelty in my work environment.  Aside from that I'd want to show my willing with my company and demonstrate to my bosses that I can be relied upon."
10462928701,"I would first ask my supervisor who put in the request first as vacation should be on a first come first serve basis. If they made the request first, then I would defer to them and reschedule. If we really did request it at exactly the same time, I would want to know more about why the colleague can't move their plans and look at my situation as well. If they are being reasonable, and I'm flexible, I wouldn't make a conflict and reschedule my vacation.","I would want to go ahead and get started on the project. Knowing my boss, I would want to make as much progress now. I would probably try to get feedback from him as soon as possible too to see if I can make those last minute changes sooner.","I would try to talk to them to encourage them to go to the event. If they aren't going, I would consider backing out, but I would probably still go. If it's with a key client, I should probably go.","I would ask for a meeting with him to discuss further. I would want to understand how he came to that conclusion, and try to share my perspective. I would want to know how I can improve if we can't come to an agreement.",I think it sounds pretty exciting. I would want to learn as much as I can and see if I can find a way to travel there for business and maybe bring my family along some. I would definitely volunteer.
10459807763,I would probably change my plans.  If it were really important I might dig in my heels. I might see how had more seniority and if I did I might call in my senioriity especially if this person took alot of time off.,I would try to have as much done on my project as early as I could. I might line up some help for some of the easier aspects of my project. Or I might tell my boss that I had to focus on my project to assign someone else to the new work.,I would probably go and network as much as I could. I might not go though. it would depend on how I was doing at work. Would I need brownie points & would I score a bunch.,"I might take a quick poll of my coworkers and ask for their feedback. I might research my year and make a list of what I;ve accomplished. I f I thought it was incorrect or wrong, I might ask for a meeting with my boss.","I would enjoy this and would volunteer. I would like to learn about other cultures and I love trivia, so I would like this assignment. I would probably volunteer to go thee it would be interesting."
10446115513,It would depend whether I need to take vacation that week. I would most likely take vacation at a later date as I am not really a confrontational person. This would also make me appear to be more mature and a person who 'takes the high road'.,"I would like to get this project done as soon as possible. I would also aim to accomplish 80% of this project, so if my boss asked if I could do a last minute task I could say that I need to finish this project. And if I really needed to do that task I could easily finish the project and start on one of the new tasks.",I would try to convince my colleague that they should go as that would be beneficial to them. This is a little self-serving as them joining would make the networking event less awkward.,I feel a bit shorted about this situation and I wouldn't want to blow up. So I would ask to set up a meeting in the near future with my manager to discuss the intricacies of his feedback. I would like to really suss out whether the feedback is valid.,"I would find this experience to be quite enjoyable. First off, I love geography and facts about countries so doing research would be interesting for me. Additionally, the possibility of travelling would also be exciting."
10459682286,"I wouls talk with my wife to see what other vacation weeks may work with her work schedule. If we can work it out, I'll request another week. If not, I will tell my boss I am senior and I will be taking the week I first selected.",I would first take a close look at what the project due in two weeks requires. I would then go about doing those tasks required to complete the project before the deadline. I would leave some time at the end in the event my boss has other needs.,"First I would try to talk my colleague into attending the meeting. I would make him aware of how important the network meeting is. If that fails, I would attend the meeting and get any information that may help both my company and our clients company.",First I must say I am more then disappointed as my work record has always been in the top 5% of all workers. Next I would talk with my supervisor to ensure I know exactly where it is believed I have not performed. I would then set out to convince my boss that the feedback is inaccurate and my bonus should not be with held.,"I would find this experience very enjoyable and exciting. I say that because the opportunity to learn about a foreign country would allow me to grow as a person ans hopefully, I would be able to learn much about the culture. I would even try to convince my boss I would be very open to travel to experience the culture first hand."
10460123574,"I would be willing to. Everything happens for a reason, and I'm always the more flexible one. I don't mind compromising to keep the peace and professionalism. But this is also something I wouldn't do always, otherwise people would just take advantage. I'm sure my co-worker is cool and someone I get along with as I tend to do with most co-workers, so I definitely wouldn't mind taking the vacation after he/she gets back. I can be a workaholic and like my job. I don't mind at all.","I would do the project as soon as possible and get it out of the way, so that I don't end up doing it last minute. I would take a meticulous and proactive approach since I already know my boss's ways and personality. If he/she is the type to give me extra work and on demand for last minute, then I would prepare because I would like to do well for the company and make it look good and competent, and I would like the same for myself. So that I am seen as being responsible. Typically, I am a take charge kind of person, employee.","I would still go, I can be pretty spontaneous and adventurous like that. I can do things on my own without having to depend on anyone. I prefer to be independent. You get so much more done.  Also, I figure why not, I can be social and like to meet new people. I think this networking could be productive as it is with an important client. Like I said, I always want things to be more, to grow more professional, and have good relations, as such. I stay positive always when it comes to my job. I think this will have a productive outcome, so I will definitely attend. I'm a hard worker. Sounds good!","I would confront my manager and take her aside and talk to her in a calm, professional manner. I am someone that likes to stand up for myself because I know what I bring to the table. If I am wrong, I take it and if not, I feel it is wrong, I speak from the heart. That's just the way I am. I can only do my part and then I will see what the other party claims and if we can meet in the middle somehow. Communication is very, very important! Plus if I knew something would carry real consequences I wouldn't have done it, I am a very moral, caring and cautious person and this includes work. So I would definitely give a feedback about my manager's feedback of me and I have many questions to clear it up and see if I truly deserve it or not!","I would definitely find this enjoyable. I am someone that likes to learn about other cultures and lifestyles. Also, this will benefit the company I work for, greatly. I've always been intrigued by Norway and the people there, I only wish travelling there was included as a part of this project. That would have been nice also, but regardless, this would be something I'm interested in and would volunteer."
10459713629,"I would first talk with my colleague to see what he or she was planning to do for their vacation. I would then tell my colleague what my vacation plans were. If both of us had vacation plans that could easily be rescheduled, then I would offer to change my vacation days as well. We would talk it out and come to a decision as to which of us would change days. But if I was planning my vacation to coincide with a big event such as a wedding or graduation, I would tell my colleague that I would like to accept his or her generous offer to change their plans so that I could attend the event.","I would complete the project as soon as I could. I believe that my boss would appreciate me completing a project ahead of schedule as opposed to turning it in on the due date. Also, Murphy may turn up - what can go wrong will go wrong. So, I would use some ""Murphy repellent"" and complete the project early.","I would go. It really isn't important to me whether or not I know anyone else at the event. I would go out of respect and consideration for my client. It's just a Golden Rule kind of thing. If I were a client and had invited one of my suppliers to a networking meeting, I would want him or her to come with me.","I would first give the situation a lot of thought. I would ask myself if I could be wrong. Is it possible that my manager is right? If I'm convinced that my manager is wrong, I would ask myself why he or she holds the opinions that resulted in the feedback. I would perhaps discuss the situation with a trusted colleague that I respect. Finally, I would probably ask for another meeting with my manager to explain why I think his or her opinion about the situation is incorrect. If I don't change the manager's opinion, I would then decide whether or not to take further action (like talking to the manager's boss or even looking for another job) or to just put it behind me and move forward with my work.","I would definitely volunteer for this assignment. It sounds like a lot of fun. I would love to dive into learning about Norway and its culture. And if the company needed me to travel to Norway, I'd be more than happy to go."
10462860542,"I would most likely change my plans unless I had a family event I had to attend. I am usually able to be flexible. This would build good will with my colleague and perhaps give me a future favor. It would not be worth fighting over, especially since I am usually so flexible in scheduling.","I would complete as much of the project as soon as possible. However, I would not ""deliver"" the project until closer to the due date. In this way, I have built in the time to complete the project as best as I can, but have taken into account the likelihood of last minute additions. I would therefore take advantage of the light workload to get the project done in advance.","I would not go to the event because I do not do well at networking events. I am not very outgoing and do not do well at networking events, so the benefit to me or my organization would be rather minimal if I did attend. I would rather focus on going home and relaxing and returning the next day refreshed and ready to perform well.",I would feel very negatively. I would try to speak with the manager to make sure that we both understood what precipitated the feedback and to answer any of their questions. I would also try to rectify any of the performance issues so that the feedback could potentially be amended and improved. I would at the very least voice my disagreement with the manager's assessment.,"I would find this experience enjoyable. I enjoy learning about other cultures and languages. Even without a travel component, I would enjoy having a reason to learn more about Norway. I would especially value having structure to the learning, as that would make me more likely to complete the tasks and actually learn the material."
10459660672,"I would insist on keeping my vacation days if I had requested them first, but if the other person requested theirs first I would change mine.  Also, if I had time-sensitive plans I would plead my case for keeping my original vacation days.  If my plans weren't time sensitive I would change days.","I would relax and enjoy the light workload leading up to the due date.  If there's a last-minute task, I'll deal with it when it happens.  I don't see any point in concerning myself with an unknown new task that may or may not be assigned.","I would probably go because they're my largest client.  If my colleague doesn't go, then I will definitely go so someone will be there to represent our company.  If my colleague does decide to go, then I might skip it and let them represent both of us.","I would feel annoyed that I might lose a bonus due to inaccurate information.  I would go to my manager and address their mistake.  If that didn't work, I would likely go over their head.","I would find it more boring than enjoyable, and more of an unpleasant and time-consuming chore than either.  I expect most of the information I'd be learning would be unnecessary, and I doubt I would be adequately compensated for the time I would have to spend learning it.  If I were there on vacation and learning about the culture voluntarily it would be different."
10459970271,I would see if I could change my vacation plans to accommodate the work schedule.  I would talk to my family about this.  I think it is important that I can compromise because it would make me look good to management at work.,I would try to get most of the work done on the project right away.  I would also make sure that project was finished a few days before the deadline.  I want to be ready for any last minute tasks my boss may have for me.,"I would stress the opportunity for advancement to my coworker.  If they did not want to go, I would go anyway.  I don't want to miss out on any positive opportunities.","I would feel very disappointed.  I would ask my manager how he has arrived at these feelings and for facts relating to the negative feedback.  If he does not cooperate, I would then talk to human resources about the situation.",I would find the experience enjoyable.  I love to learn about different cultures and countries.  I have a great interest in travel.
10459733601,"I would probably need to discuss with them further about why they are not willing to change plans and decide who has a greater need to change. If they didn't work with me and talk to me, I would probably discuss that with my supervisor. If they had a greater need and/or more urgent reason to take this particular time off, then I would reschedule my time off.",I would go ahead and do all of or most of the project right now. I would know that my boss might give me a last minute task and prepare for that. Plus this way if I got it done early then the days leading up to the due date could be pretty easy. I might as well get it taken care of than sit on it.,"I would first try to encourage them to go. I would bring up important points like how this is our largest client and it would look really good for us to be there. I'd bring up the awkwardness of not knowing anyone. If they insisted on not going, I would probably still go. It would be awkward but it could look good to the client.","I would evaluate what the feedback was carefully and gather evidence to the contrary. I would go to the manager and present these facts to him, along with a message about why it is important, how I felt, etc. If the manager were unwilling to budge then I would probably seek the next level of power above him for help. I would not let something like this go lightly as it could be damaging to my finances and my career.","I would be interested in learning more about Norway. It seems like a pretty interesting country. I would be open to being this volunteer. However, I know I would want to travel there to get the full experience."
10459750194,"I would carefully consider what I am planning to do on this vacation versus what they are planning to do. If mine was something very important like a best friend's wedding in another state, and if there's was something that could be moved to another time, I would continue talking to the coworker about why this is important. I would not give up. I would see if there was anything I could offer them to change their mind","I would start working on it right away. The sooner I finish it, the sooner I will have free time at work. I would play it safe by getting it done.",I would probably not go. It would depend on how tired I was or how important it was that either myself or my colleague went. I might try to get my colleague to join me.,I would wait a couple days in case my boss was in a bad mood. I would work hard during this time to make myself look good. Then I would go to my manager again to discuss why I think it was unfair.,I would find it to be exciting because of the opportunity to grow in my career. I would not necessarily be excited about Norway itself. I would get bored at times but focus on the bigger picture.
10459728252,"Unless I had somewhere I had to be such as a family wedding, I would change my week for vacation.  I think my supervisor would appreciate my willingness to change the week and it is not a big enough issue to negotiate with my colleague since for some reason he is unwilling to change.  If I did need that week in particular, I would ask that both of us talk to the supervisor and decide who has a more compelling reason for vacation to be that week.  Based on this, a decision could be made.","I would immediately begin working on the project and finish it as quickly as I could and do an excellent job.  Two weeks can go by very quickly and as my boss may give me a last minute task it is very important to do the project when my work is lighter.  If the project involves waiting for information, I would finish all I could each day.   All most every project has some problems along the way and it is always best to not waste time along the way.  In this project, there is no time to waste.",I would definitely go to the networking meeting with one of my largest clients.  I would try to convince my colleague to come along but if they could not then I would introduce myself at the meeting and get to know the people.  It is very important to attend these meetings and completely expected that I would be there.  I would go with a very positive and upbeat attitude and try to enjoy the meeting.  I should know the people of my clients and should not have to rely on my colleague.,"I would be very upset about this situation and discuss my feelings with my manager.  If after this discussion, I still felt it was the feedback was not true and it did not change, I would talk to the next person in command.  However, I would only do this if I felt I was very wronged and I would tell my manager that I was going to talk to the next in command.  Doing this may hurt my relationship with my manager so I would only do this as a last resort.  Employers like employees who do not cause trouble and managers at all levels are part of the same teem so all of this needs to be considered and possible losing my job before I go to the next level.","I would really enjoy working on the project with the client from Norway.  I would find it very interesting to learn more about their country and culture.  I would be willing to travel if the need arose.  There is so much that is unique about every country, it would broaden my knowledge and life.  It would also speak well of me with my company."
10459697683,I would find another time to take my vacation. This would show how flexible I am to my boss. It would show my dedication to the company and hopefully would lead to a quicker advancement.,"I would start it right away. I don't like to procrastinate and want to make sure it's done on time. Also, this allows for any surprises that may happen down the road.",I would go anyhow. I like going into situations where I can meet people from different backgrounds. I'm very personable and want to be the face of my company.,I would be angry with it and work harder. This has happened to me before in a mid year review where my bonus was going to be 0-15K if I din't get on the NOK trades. I simply threatened some people in the pit and ended up getting a nice year end bonus.,No I wouldn't want to do this. I know nothing of the Norwegian culture. This is too much to take on at the time without extra incentive.
10459661249,"I would explain that my plans were not changeable either and I would lose money if I had to change dates of my vacation.  I would suggest the supervisor use a lottery system to decide who can take the week of vacation, as we would both be out money to cancel plans.  I would accept whatever the supervisor decides and change my plans, if need be.","I would go ahead and finish the project early, therefore, if any last minute tasks were handed to me I would have time to finish.  Also, by finishing the project early, and if I had spare time, I would continue reviewing the project to make sure it was completed to my high expectations.","I would try to convince my colleague to go for just a short time, meet and greet, and then could leave. If the colleague continued to decline going, I would go myself for a short period of time, who knows, I may meet someone interesting to network with.","I would ask the manager what prompted the negative feedback as my work had been positive in the past. I would ask the manager for enlightenment on how to turn around this negative feedback so that it doesn't happen in the future. Also, I would explain I was really counting on the annual bonus and if there was something I could do to make up for the negative feedback.","I would find the experience enjoyable as I like to learn about new cultures. Volunteering on this project would let me get to know the culture without traveling. However, I would hope at some point I would be able to travel to Norway and experience the culture for myself."
10440138555,"I would probably just change my vacation if it wouldn't be a major inconvenience.  If it was a situation where i'd put down a non-refundable deposit or something like that, I'd have a private conversation with my coworker and/or my boss.  I would also request that everyone receive a copy of the company's protocol and rules for requesting vacation time so that I could prevent a situation like this in the future.","I would definitely do my best to knock out and complete the project as soon as possible. Since my workload is currently light, it would behoove me to use my downtime to work diligently and complete the project well before its due date.  It will take some pressure off. As well, additional work pops up that needs to be done later, I'll be able to focus on it without the stress of the project looming over my head.","I would encourage my colleague to come along. If s/he chose not to, i'd still go. Mixing with an important client can be beneficial to me professionally.  It can also help my company so, I should go.","I would first take a deep breath and clear my head. Following that, I'd set aside some time to really think about what my manager said. I'd try to think objectively and determine why s/he said what she did.  If I was still convinced that the feedback was unwarranted, i'd reach out to HR or someone over the manger's head in order to discuss my concerns, present evidence to the contrary, etc","I would definitely volunteer. I enjoy travel and learning about other cultures. Even though I would not be traveling this time, I'd be learning something and, with any luck, someday I might be able to visit Norway (for work or leisure) and have some knowledge about the culture and place."
10446109281,I would take a time to talk it out with my colleague. We can work something out and not have to risk our jobs. This would bring a more concrete solution to the issue. I think this is something we will have to do.,I would do my best to complete the project with the best of my efforts. Then I would make some rooms available for additional tasks given by my boss. That way it will allow me to ensure I complete all tasks sent my way. I would do this in this situation.,"I would talk it out with my colleague and convince him or her to go with me. I think I can convince my colleague to go with me so I don't feel alone. Also, if my colleague doesn't choose to go with me then it is fine I will go alone and meet new people.",I would make an appointment to meet with the manager to further discuss my feedback at work. This would provide us a time to talk about the reasons behind the feedback and ensure that the feedback is fair. I think this will prevent any misunderstandings and dramas.,I would find this travel to be fun and something new in my life. I would do more research before volunteering myself. It would be a new experience that I don't get to experience. It will be fun in my own opinion.
10440097924,I would chat with my colleague and see if we could work out something like maybe he can cover for me wheni have alot of work. Working together is important and i would tell the boss what agreement we made.So he would note we are working together or if the other person did not live up to his bargin theboss would know.,Of course i would start this project now . Working ahead can help when last minute tasks happen. This way i would be ahead of the game and able to get everythigndone in time.,I would go anyway and it is a networking meeting and you can get to know people.  Be yourself always works and be a good example for the company you work for.,I would ask for examples why the boss feels this way. Then try and do what he or she feels i am not doing. I would explain to him i always try and do my best and maybe we could work together on what he feels i am not doing.,Actually it is always fun to look at the place you live with different eyes.It puts you in touch with what you like about the country and you get to make a new friend from another country. Personally i would enjoy the experience.
10459770847,I would ask our supervisor to see who has worked the longest at the company. Then the company could decide who has the most sinorrity. The person with the most time at this job could take the vacation.,i would try to get the project done as soon as possible. That way if the boss gave me last minute tasks to do it wouldn't be a problem. I like to get things done early anyway.,I think i would try to talk my colleagues into going with me. If that didn't work. I would go to the meeting since its one of my largest clients. And i think it would be good for business.,I wouldn't feel good about the situation. I would ask my manager to go over any negative feedback he has about me. And i would try to plea my case.,I would volunteer for this project. I would find it very enjoyable to learn about Norway. I think it would be wonderful to learn about a different culture.
10446113108,I would probably change my plans if I didn't have something big planned.  I would not want a confrontation so I would likely give in.  I could always tell my family or friends I couldn't get off and we have to make different plans.,I would work to get the project completed as quickly as possible.  This would give me time to revise it and perfect it if I didn't get last minute tasks.  If I did get last minute tasks I would be in good shape.,"I would go to the meeting for a little bit since it is an important client.  I would not plan to stay long and would have an excuse to leave.  However, I think it would be important for my client relationship and professional success to go.  I may also be surprised and have a good time.",I would setup a meeting with my manager to talk through it.  If we could not come to an agreement I would go to human resources to discuss it with them.  If I could not get it changed I would at least want it on record that I did not agree with the feedback.,I would find it enjoyable.  I enjoy learning about other cultures and history.  I would get fully consumed by Norway are and learn a lot.  I would also likely plan a trip in the future even if I couldn't go now.
10460023819,I would discuss the situation with my supervisor and the colleague at the same time. The decision should come down to who asked for the time off first. The person who asked first should be allowed to take off and the other person will have to reschedule their vacation time. It is the only fair way to make the choice.,"I would budget in extra time the few days before the project is due. Also, I would do as much of the project as I could while my work load is still fairly light. I would rather be ahead of time on the project when my boss hits me with unexpected work than risk not fulfilling the due date.","I would base my decision on how well I think the meeting will go even though I won't know anyone there. I wouldn't want to feel obligated to attend the meeting just because it is a large client. Also, I might try and convince my colleague to attend the meeting even if they are leaning not going.","I would schedule a meeting with my manager to discuss the feedback. I would put together as much tangible evidence to disprove the negative feedback to the meeting. I would ask for specific clarifications on each of the negative points and do my best to have logical, strong counterpoints to these specifics then ask for an updated evaluation.",I would find this experience enjoyable as long as it didn't involved learning too much of the language. I enjoy learning about different countries and cultures so being able to do so while being paid would be excellent. Doing good work on this project might lead to my assignment with other international clients and being able to learn about other countries and cultures.
10440105074,"I would be willing to change my vacation week. However, I would be less willing to do favors for my colleague in the future. I am a team player so I would want to accommodate my supervisor.","I would go ahead and work extra on the project to finish it ahead of schedule. That way if my boss surprises me with additional work at the last minute, I won't feel as overwhelmed. Also, I enjoy finishing tasks early so I no longer have to worry about them.","I would definitely attend the networking meeting. Yes, it would be nice if I knew someone else there. However, I like meeting new people, and this event will give me a chance to connect with other professionals in my field.","I would directly address my manager about the negative feedback. I would ask for a bit more clarity. However, I would provide a strong response to clear up any misconceptions about my work.",I would volunteer for this project. I would enjoy learning about Norway and its culture. This would give me some additional insights that could provide me with valuable international experience.
10459661016,"I would ask who put in for the vacation first.  That is, whoever asked first should be the one to get it granted.  If he had asked first, then I wouldn't have a basis to object to not being allowed to take that week off.  Likewise, he should not be granted that week if I had already asked for it.","I would work through lunch and come in a few days early, or work late.  I would hope and pray my boss would leave me alone for long enough to do my work.  If she overloads me at the last minute, I would ask that she allow me to finish my project first.","I would go to the meeting.  This is my biggest client and I do not want to offend them.  I might find a way to leave as soon as I could, but I would definitely spend time there.",I would just ignore the situation.  I've fought bad reviews before and got nowhere but fired.  I would hope to outlast my supervisor because I feel I have no recourse.,I would find this experience boring.  I am not much of a nurturer and this person would take a lot of time and energy.  I'd defer to someone who would enjoy doing this type of thing.
10460107447,"I would try and talk with my co-worker some more to see if there was any way they could work with me.  If I already had stuff set up for my vacation, like things booked and money put down, I would talk with my supervisor and see if they would be willing to work with me.  If all that failed, I would just concede and change my vacation.","I would make sure to get my important stuff done for the day, then, I would work a little a day on the project due in 2 weeks.  If I could push some of my daily work to the next day, I may just try and work on the special project for longer, so I could make sure I would finish the special project by the due date.","I would definitely try to talk my colleague into going with me. I would try and explain how important it would be for us to attend this meeting, with one of our largest clients.  If they still said no, I wouldn't want to go but I would go and not worry about not knowing anyone else there.","I would definitely feel upset, especially if the feedback is false. Before defending myself, I would make sure I could gather up information that would prove that the feedback was false.  I wouldn't be mean about it, to my boss, but I would want to make sure I had evidence proving the feedback was wrong, before I go telling my boss they are wrong.","I definitely would find the experience kind of boring.  I'm not one that enjoys being out of my comfort zone, so I would not look forward to having to interact with Norway.  However, I would still do what was needed to, successfully interact with Norway, to make my company look good."
10440097709,I would do it because I assume that my colleague must have asked first.  I would ask my supervisor if that is the case and what the criteria was.  I would honor the request with no problems if it was fair.  I would take my vacation another week.,"I would do it right away.  I always anticipate extra work.  That way it is done and I  would not have to worry about it.  Besides, it is less stressful this way.",I would ask my colleague if he understand the opportunity being presented.  I would reitterate the impact.  I would be ok if he or she did not go after being told as it would not turn out well if he or she was not positive about it.,I would feel dissapointed.  I would ask my manager to have a one on one with me to discuss.  I would want a plan to be developed with him to improve or possible give him more info.,"I would love to volunteer for the project.  I love to learn about new cultures.  I think that the more diverse ideas, the better we are.  I would enjoy it."
10440124716,I would take a look at my schedule and see whether I could take vacation another time. If the circumstances allowed me I would reschedule to alleviate the problem. This would help me look better to my boss in that I do what is necessary for the company.,I would hurry up and finish the project. I would do this so that I have extra time for any last minute things that come up. This would make me prepared for anything that happens.,"I would go to get ahead. Even if I didn't want to go, because it is important I would force myself to go. Without my other coworker there I would have a better chance of making an impression.",I would not be happy if I felt the feedback was incorrect. I would look over the situation and try to make sure I was right about my thoughts. After that I would bring the issue up with my boss and see if I can get him to see my point of view better.,I would find it a little bit intimidating. It could also be a good thing so I would be tempted to try it. If I could get myself interested in learning about Norway it would help a lot.
10440104837,I would let my supervisor know that my coworker was not willing to be flexible. I would be flexible and change my vacation. It would be important to me that my supervisor knows who the team player was in this situation.,I would try to immediately do as much work as possible on the project. I would stay in touch with my boss regarding my progress and let him know that I was prepared for any last minute changes. I would also triple check my performance on the project considering my light workload.,"I would still go. Not knowing anyone is a great impetus to meeting new people. Just because I don't know these people, we would still have a lot in common and it would be a good opportunity to expand my contacts. It's really not much of a commitment to make and the rewards could be very high.",I would ask to to dig deeper into the matter with my supervisor. i'd try to figure out where we disagreed on the feedback. I would also try to lay out a plan with my supervisor that had tangible goals so I wouldn't be blindsided next time.,"i would find the project enjoyable and, who knows, perhaps a trip to Norway would happen. It's always great to get paid to learn and this is a perfect example of that. Not only would the research be interesting, but it could possibly result in better future opportunities. I would see no downside to this situation."
10442498639,I would negotiate with my colleague. I would tell them that I would take a different week but they would have to cover for me at a later day. I would make sure that my supervisor also knew of the agreement.,I would finish the already assigned tasks and ask my boss if there was anything else that needed to be done. I would make it clear to my boss that I am ready to finish the task early. This would prevent any last minute delays.,"I would go to the meeting. This client is very important so I wouldn't want to miss the opportunity. Even though I wouldn't know anyone, it would be an opportunity to make new contacts.",I would appeal the feedback with my supervisor. I would explain to him why I do not agree. If my supervisor took issue then I would speak with upper management.,I would find this experience interesting. I like learning about different cultures so I would not be bored. I would relish the learning experience.
10440129443,I would gracefully accept to change my vacation week and make the best of it and show that I am a teamplayer.  I would seek to make a good impression with my colleague and my boss.,I would manage my time in such a way as I am prepared for the backend load of my project.  I would measure the last days of my deadline to be ready for any heavy workload at the end of the deadline and focus my attention on finishing this project at a high level and finish the light work that I have left immediately so that I have no supprises at the end.,"I would encourage my colleague to go with me and offer to buy him lunch if he went.  If my colleague did not go I would take this moment to network and get to know more people aswell as grow my relationship with my largest client.  I would focus my time on making sure all the needs were being met of our largest client, and be sure he is satisfied.",I would be extremely upset and immediately go to him and ask him in a respectful way how I could improve with him and meet his expectations.  I would try to reconcile any fall out with him and if not I would handle the consequences with grace.,"I would find this experience to be enjoyable to interact with the client from norway.  I would enrich my knowledge of different cultures and get to know more about how individuals from Norway do business and interact.  This type of project with be a point of great personal growth for myself personally and professionally, and add to my resume significantly."
10440101535,"I would just choose a different week. Unless this vacation was centered around a holiday or family event, I would have no problem picking a different time. I would maybe choose something even sooner.",I would get it done as soon as I have some spare time. I would want to get it off my plate. I would not want to have to worry about it later.,"I would first try to convince the colleague to go. If that didn't work, I would suck it up and try to do it on my own. I have no problem going somewhere where I don't know anyone. The purpose of the meeting is networking afterall.",I would feel not comfortable at all with the situation. I would maybe go above my manager's rank and talk to someone. I would be sure to gather all the evidence and proof needed to make my point.,"I would find this experience extremely enjoyable. I am of Scandinavian descent, so I would love the chance to learn more about the culture. I would have absolutely no problem traveling there if the chance were to arise."
10459715404,"I would first evaluate how difficult it would be for me to change my vacation plans (including whether my flights or hotels were booked, whether I would be missing big family events or not). If it was not too financially difficult or upsetting to change my vacation plans, I would change them so that I could please my boss. If I needed to take that week off, I would talk to my supervisor. I would explain my situation and see if it would be possible to make an exception. I might make an offer to work during another major holiday or vacation time instead.",I would start the project immediately and create a timeline to get it done. I would leave more than enough time to have it finished in case my boss gave me another assignment. I would schedule to finish it a few days in advance. I would also be honest with my supervisor about my availability for short term tasks.,"I would still go to the networking event. Even though it might be awkward, it is still a good opportunity to go and meet some new people. Also, I would want to be courteous to our clients, especially since they are one of our largest clients, and attend the event anyways to show them that we care about them and prioritize them.",I would feel pretty upset about the situation. I would honestly probably seek the advice of one of my close friends or family members on how to deal with it because I would be really upset. I would approach my boss after and talk to them about why I felt like the feedback was unjustified but also make it clear that I was committed to improving.,I would find this experience enjoyable because I like learning about other cultures and different countries. I would be excited to be learning while at work and also to be able to use my research skills. I would enjoy being an expert on the topic as well.
10459681718,"I would contact my partner and try to find another time that is agreeable for the both of us.  This would not be too much of an inconvenience as I would not have been foolish enough to make plans (reservations etc.) before I was certain I could have the time off.  As I also feel that my colleague is being a bit stubborn and selfish, especially considering that I would have conceded anyway, I would call them out on it.  I would tell that in the nicest and least argumentative way possible that we all work together to find solutions at our company.   I would suggest that in the future they communicate with others rather than behave in this manner.","I would complete this project as soon as possible.  Once completed I should have ample time to review the project for mistakes and improvements.  In this way, I will likely avoid having to work on my project and complete last minute tasks at the same time.  I feel this will reduce stress and keep me fully prepared for whatever comes my way.","I would try to convince my colleague to attend the meeting.  I would point out that is a good a opportunity.  If that doesn't work, I tell them that I would feel more comfortable if they came with me, which is true.  If they still refuse, then I can do no more in their regard.  I would still attend this meeting on my own, even if it is uncomfortable.  This is an opportunity to network with the client and to show my employers that I take my work seriously.","I would address the issue with my manager.  I would make sure to ask what it is, in their opinion, that I can do better.  I would have to humble myself a bit to ask because I know I would feel a bit slighted if I believe it to be untrue.  I would hope that by asking how my manager thinks I can improve it will show them that care about their opinion as well as my own and that I am wiling to try to improve.","I would find aspects of this situation both enjoyable and boring.  I would be excited to learn about the country and the culture.  I am sure there are interesting things to learn.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with expanding the mind in this way and I usually enjoy such for a while.  I would, however, get bored after a while by the lack of actual interaction with the Norwegian territory."
10459865210,If my plans were incredibly important I would explain that to my supervisor. If my plans were not then I would accept that it wasn't my turn to take vacation. I would hope the supervisor would take into consideration the situation and intervene if necessary.,I would start on the project as if it were due right away. That way if any interruptions happened I would be well on my way. I would also explain my situation to my supervisor so they are aware.,"I would try to convince my colleague to go. If they decided not to go, I would try to be brave. I would still go because of the opportunities it might present.","I would have a calm and private conversation with my supervisor to try and come to an understanding. If I felt that we could not do that, I would go to HR to have a supervised conversation. I would listen intently and try to be fair about the feedback.","I would find the experience enjoyable. Even if travel was not involved, I would probably have a chance to communicate with people from another country. I would be sure to learn a lot."
10459753996,"Assuming I don't have a pressing thing to attend to, I'd change my vacation week. This will probably curry some favor and isn't a big deal for me. It's different if I do have a pressing matter or something I don't want to miss very badly. In that case I'd probably explain to my supervisor what is going on and if applicable, request they hire a temp for that week.","I would focus on the big project early. I tend to get more important projects outlined and done ahead of deadlines, and use smaller tasks at breaks. I know it'll be less stressful later in and when my boss assigns more tasks, instead of making it harder on myself by leaving the work till the last minute.","I would probably go to the networking thing. Meeting people is pretty easy for me, so I wouldn't be worried about not knowing anyone there. Also, ""it's who you know"" is very true and networking is important. Plus if I'm working on whatever projects the big client needs, I'll have plenty to talk about with the new people.","I would ask others for advice. This might be a pick your battles situation. Maybe whatever I'm being told off for really happened and I can learn from it. If it's fully unfair, I'd talk to the person giving the review and try to talk then out of it, and/or go to their higher-up if it's something really important.",I would find it enjoyable. I love traveling and I love Europe. Having never been to Norway I would love to learn more about it. The only issue would be the time difference and negotiating when to host calls if there are any team members abroad. I'd be especially eager if there was a monetary incentive to volunteer.
10440103427,I WOULD TALK WITH MY COLLEAGUE AND FIND OUT WHY THIS WEEK IS SO IMPORTANT. I WOULD TRY TO WORK ON A COMPROMISE. IT THAT DID NOT WORK I WOULD SET UP A TIME TO MEET MY SUPERVISOR AND WORK OUT A SOLUTION.,I WOULD START TO WORK ON THE PROJECT IMMEDIATELY. I WOULD MAKE SURE I COMPLETED THE PROJECT BEFORE THE DUE DATE. I WOULD CONTINUE TO COMMUNICATE WITH MY BOSS TO KEEP APPRAISED OF ANY CHANGES OR ADDITIONS TO MY JOB TASKS.,I WOULD CERTAINLY GO TO THE MEETING. THE FACT I WOULD NOT KNOW ANYONE IS NOT A PROBLEM. THE CHANCE TO MEET MEMBERS OF ONE OF OUR BIGGEST CLIENTS AND NETWORK THEM WOULD HELP ME AND THE COMPANY. GREAT WAY TO HELP BOTH PARTIES.,I WOULD BE CONCERNED. I WOULD TAKE A HARD LOOK AT WHAT I HAVE DONE AND ADJUST IF I FELT IT WAS NEEDED. I WOULD SET UP A FOLLOW UP MEETING WITH MY MANAGER AND DISCUSS IN DETAIL WHAT MY MANGER'S CONCERNS WERE AND WHAT I COULD DO TO CHANGE MYMANGER'S PERCEPTION OF ME.,I HAVE ALWAYS WANTED TO EXPERIENCE THE CULTURE AND LIFE OF ANOTHER COUNTRY. THIS WOULD BE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY. I WOULD WORK HARD TO LEARN ABOUT THE COUNTRY AND ITS CULTURE. I WOULD MEET AS MANY PEOPLE AS A I COULD TO ENJOY MY TIME IN THE COUNTRY.
10459975891,I would go talk with my colleague to figure out which one has the most important plans for vacation. If he has important plans done already I would let him go in exchange for when I need help he will help. If he doesn't have then I will try to convince him to let me go instead.,I would start to finish the load I have before to be ready if my boss gives me more work. I wouldn't finish the work that I have already to seem like I'm busy with work so I won't get in trouble or get more work. That way if he does give me more I will be ready.,I would try to convince him to go with me. I will explain how important it is for use to be at our clients party. It could cost us important clients in the future. If it's not important then I would not go either.,I would go talk to my manager to get a better explanation of what the feedback is about. I would try to explain why he might not be correct and will show him how I did it correctly and explain. I would ask him to give me new feedback in the future.,I would find it an enjoyable experience to do. I could learn about his culture in the meanwhile. I would talk to him about some things he's curious about my culture. I like to show him about my culture and country.
10459667728,I would try to change my plans if possible just so the colleague could keep their plans enjoy vacation,I would let the boss know how much time and attention my project requires and ask nicely if he could allocate the small tasks to another worker until i complete the project,If it is important for me to go then i would certainly try no matter if my colleague goes or not it might be a little awkward not knowing anyone but showing up is important to future career,I would feel upset about it and i would ask to speak privately state my case of truth hopefully carrying proof that it is wrong and ask him to look over it again please,I would find it enjoyable learning the culture and customs of other people and country i have always been interested in learning about different cultures their beliefs likes dislikes what life is like
10459723538,"I would change the date of my vacation, unless it was important I not change the date.  In that case I would suggest my co-worker and I discuss the importance of both of us being gone on the same date.  If they were not happy about me not changing my mind, either, I would suggest we pull straws.",I would have the project done before the due date because I can predict my boss will assign another project to me between now and then.  I'm presently under a light workload.  It should be easy to have the project finished before it is due to be finished.,"I would not miss the networking meeting with one of my largest clients.  I would try to talk my coworker into going with me.  We are both tired, but attending the meeting seems important.  Having to go doesn't sound like bad luck.  I'm sure I will be glad I went.","I would talk to my boss more about the negative feedback to make sure my boss and I are on the same page.  I take my work seriously and want to make sure I really understand the negative feedback.  I really appreciate bonuses and don't want to lose any.  I would calm down and ask to speak with my boss more about the feedback, later.","I would really enjoy this project.  I was just reading about Scandinavia today.  The countryside is not like I've imagined it.  It isn't part of the EU.  Norway leads in technology, too."
10459662134,"I would let my collegue have the vacation dates if my schedule is flexible. If it is not flexible, I would negotiate with my collegue. I believe that we will come meet the middle ground.",I would front load as much work as possible. I would also talk to my boss to see if there is any work i can do beforehand. This will make me less stress.,I would go anyways. This is a good opportunity for me to meet. I would make it my goal to network with new people.,I would discuss the feedback further with my boss. I would ask why i was given that evaluation. I would also ask how i can improve going forward.,"I would find this project enjoyable. I like to learn new things about other countries and culture. In addition, this would help me do other things that are not my normal day to day activities."
10460070033,"I would change my plans to accommodate if I could do so.  If I was unable to change due to nonrefundable reservations, activities that are milestones, e.g. a wedding, and other like scenarios, I would not change.  I read the scenario as if I had requested first.  In this case I would reference first come, first served and refuse to adjust/insist my request be honored.","I would begin the project immediately and prioritize it as I am able, considering other tasks.  One of the tools I would use would be a preliminary mapping of the project with dates and milestones to help keep me on track and adapt should other assignments emerge.  I would do these things for 2 reasons:  to avoid procrastination and a last minute push and to strategically position for the potential of last minute requests.","I would make the decision to go and attempt my colleague to do likewise, using rational, business-related reasons that reflect the benefits.  I would also plan to stay for a limited amount of time and would predetermine who my targets are to connect with at the event.  Encouraging my colleague would provide for a greater comfort level should he/she go with me.  We could divide and conquer re: connecting with targets which would allow us to leave sooner.  I would also use this insight in an attempt to encourage attending.  This is a large client and the exposure would potentially be beneficial for my company and my career.  With that said, staying for a longer period of time would be counter productive, considering I have had a long day and do not know the people--making long conversations unnecessary.","Initially, I would feel angry and betrayed.  I would take some time to calm down and then force myself to reflect on the feedback.  If I still concluded the feedback was inaccurate, I would look for data based or other backable information to provide at a future conversation I request.  Taking a strategic stance based on reflection helps me move away from anger and address the issue.  If I was unsuccessful in getting adjusted feedback, I would revert to a style of keeping notes, assuring understanding of expectations, etc. and seek to both perform well and maintain proof should this scenario repeat itself.",I would find this experience enjoyable.  It would be a challenge to learn about the country/culture but having it attached to a work-based project provides additional motivation and rewards.  It also adds a new and interesting dimension to the work that I do.
10441702977,I would explain to my colleague that it is very important for me to take this week of vacation because I have a non-refundable deposit. I would extend an offer to my colleague that if they will change their plans to a different week that I will cover for them the next time they need time off. I might even negotiate with them taking part of the week prior and then the first few days of the target week if they will take the latter part of the target week plus a few days the following week so we can each keep our plans.,I would approach my boss as the project due date nears and ask my boss to lighten up any potential tasks that may arise and remind them that I will be focusing on completing the two-week project. I might offer to work overtime if necessary or delegate some responsibilities if necessary to meet the deadline. I would try to work with my boss in a pre-emotive way so that problems don’t occur and the project can be completed on a timely basis.,"I would encourage my colleague to go to this network meeting. I would explain to them my position that we are very fortunate to be invited to this meeting with one of our largest clients and that it might be an opportunity that could never exist again. I might even state that if we don’t go, our competitors could gain an advantage and we could lose the account. I would then tell my colleague that I’m going anyway and would really appreciate their support but if they can’t do it, I understand.","I would anticipate this kind of situation and prepare for it by keeping meticulous notes and records of my work, how I utilize my time, and any other extenuating circumstances that might have contributed to a negative review. Then I would ask the manager for a meeting to review my notes and explain any comments that might have affected me negatively. I would go on the record with my position that exonerates me of deserving any kind of negative review and document the meeting also. If necessary, I might present the documentation to a superior and ask for my bonus anyway.",I would find this experience very enjoyable. I would consider it a unique opportunity to learn and experience another culture that I would likely never do in any other scenario. I think that the opportunity to do this project would reflect very well on my work record and help establish new connections that could be beneficial now and/or later in my career.
10459992544,"I would weigh what the options are. Is this something that has been planned and paid for in advance? Is it something that is very important? If it is just random time off to get some things done, I would just change the week.","I would finish it early and spend the last couple days double checking if needed. I prefer to complete work early and not to procrastinate. This way, if there are last minute things, it is not a problem.","I would make an appearance. I likely wouldn't stay very long, especially if I didn't know anyone else there. I think it is important to keep your face familiar if possible.","I would discuss the feedback and ask to have a follow up. If it is not true, then I would look for proof and/or backup in my work, emails, etc. to prove my side of the story. I would want to have the follow up and confirm what, if any, consequences there would be.",I would find this enjoyable. I like learning about other cultures and Norway would be an interesting one. It also helps at work to volunteer and show that you are dependable.
10440159676,"I would refuse to switch my vacation. Try to make other arrangments on the work end, but also justify why you deserve to go on your vacation and if my trip is more important then make it so my coworker has to switch their vacation","i would get it all over with now. i would stay up late a few nights this week if needed to complete it now, that way if i get more projects later on unexpectedly i will be able to complete everything",I would convice and beg them to go because i cannot miss it and i absolutely do not want to go alone and not know anyone else there.,"I would ask them why they feel this way. if possible i would defend whatever they said, and explain how it isnt actually negative. if it is a bad habit then i would promise to change it immidietly.",I would find it enjoyable because i have never been out of the country. I would love to get the experience for work and for memories as well. I would think it is so exciting!
10459816539,"I would review my plans to check if there's any important events during my scheduled vacation. If there's no pressing matters, I would change my schedule to another week. If there's something very important that I have to do, I will ask the manager to make the decision about who to give the time off.","Since my workload is light. I would put some extra time into the project. That way, I will be prepared for any extra that might be assigned. It would allow me to be more efficient and not how to worry.","I would try to convince my colleague that we should attend. Attending the event would improve relations with the client. If the colleague chose not to go, I would definitely attend. Although I don't know anyone, I can use this as an oppurtunity to introduce myself to the client.","I would be devasted about the situation. If I felt that the manager is biased, I might decide to tender my resignation. If there's a chance that the manager is correct in his assesment, I would try to improve on my next review.","I would find this oppurtunity enjoyable, because I will learn about a new country and culture. It would also make me a more valuable team member. I believe that the project will lead to better oppurtunities in the future."
10459675449,"I would see if I could change my vacation. If I was able to  I would.  If I was unable to, I would dig in and stand my ground.  I want to get along if I can.",I would get the project ready early.  Then I could relax if my boss did not give me more work.  If he did I would be prepared for it.,I would go anyway.  It's a good event for my career.  I would not be completely comfortable but the rewards outweigh the risks.,I would challenge it with HR.  I would present evidence and try to get the remarks removed.  My career is too important .,I would find the experience boring.  I would only want to travel.  Learning about the culture doesn't interest me.
10459741343,"Since my colleague is adamant about not changing his/her vacation plans, I would change mine. I would do so to avoid creating a situation that would reflect badly on both of us. I would also not like our supervisor to intervene, and I understand the workload cannot withstand both of us being away at the same time.","I would complete the project right away. Given that my boss tends to give last minute tasks, I would want to be sure my project was completed so I could handle any requests coming from my boss.  Finishing the project early would also allow me to carefully review it and be assured I was turning in a quality assignment.","I would go, despite my discomfort at not knowing anyone there. It would be important to my work that I meet with this important client. Since successful networking often leads to lucrative business contracts, it would be advantageous for me to go and have a positive experience with this client.","I would feel deeply upset and  wronged. I would ask my manager to explain specifically why I received negative feedback, and ask how I could rectify this going forward. I would also try to provide my side, and why I don't feel the negative feedback is justified.","I would find this experience enjoyable. I would welcome the opportunity to learn about Norway and its culture. By volunteering for involvement in this project, I would make myself more valuable to my company, and may also be positioning myself for favorable recognition when my review time comes around."
10460416398,"I would probably try to rearrange my schedule to accommodate my colleague's plans. The why is two-fold. One I would do it to avoid trouble at work, to promote a calmer atmosphere. Work, usually is work, and there is no reason to make it worse than it has to be. Two, my willingness to make accommodations would, I suspect, make me look better to management, and if there were ever a dispute between my colleague and myself, I might look at little better than him in the dispute.","I would do my best to complete my project as quickly as possible, while still doing it properly. The why is because my boss apparently likes to dump last minute jobs on my desk. Knowing his behavior, I would work to accommodate his habits. It would serve neither of us for me to have to struggle at the last minute to do the project and the assignment he gave, so by having the project done as soon as possible, I am able to protect my job, hopefully.","I would go to the meeting without my colleague. Networking is an important part of the modern business, and even if it's uncomfortable being in a room full of strangers, I believe it is worthwhile. I would work the room as quickly as I could without being rude, and I would leave as soon as possible, unless I truly started having fun. I would also gripe my colleague out the next time I talked to him.","I would feel terribly about it and probably anxious in moving forward. I would approach my manager and, very politely and respectfully, express my concerns over his review. I would explain my understanding of the situation, explain the possible consequences, and ask him to reconsider his position. If he didn't, he would still know that I was polite and respectful, and that would not hurt me down the line.","I would find the experience very agreeable. Learning about new cultures and peoples is a hobby of mine. If I were able to do it at work, I would essentially be getting paid for my hobby. Plus, I count everything new piece of knowledge as worthwhile, not just for what it supplies me at that time, but for the doors it might open for me in the future. Also, volunteering within the company would show my managers that I am a team player and willing to do what's necessary to help the company."
10462862616,I would let my supervisor know that I have already made plans for my vacation and that I can not change them. I would also kindly ask my colleague if they can change their week off and explain to them my situation. I would let my colleague know that I really need the week off.,I would let my boss know that I am doing the best that I can. I would let them know that I may need more time to complete the project. I would tell them that it might be unrealistic to give me last minute tasks that take a lot of time.,I would probably not go. I prefer to go home and relax. I have done enough at work already.,I would explain to my manager that I do not agree with the feedback. I would explain that I am a hardworking person and don't believe I should receive it. I would ask my manager why I was given negative feedback.,I would enjoy the experience. I like learning new things and it would look good for me to be involved in the project. I might even get recognition or a raise.
10459811998,"I think it would all depend on who asked for the week off first.  If I asked for it off first, then I have first dibs on the week of vacation.  I don't think it's the employees responsibility to work it out. The supervisor should decide so coworkers don't have hard feelings toward one another.","I would make sure that I had the project completed as soon a I could.  Having the project finished or near completion, would free up time for me to do other projects that may come up.  Also, finishing the project early would show great work ethic to the boss.","I would go for a little while, but have an excuse to leave early ready if needed.  If it's a networking meeting, then chances are I'll know someone and also, it would show the client that they are important to our company.  I think it would also be a great opportunity to drum up new business.","I would talk to the supervisor more about the feedback.  Where did the person get the information, why does the manager feel it's true, what can I do to correct any misgivings? If that didn't work, I would schedule a meeting with a higher up in the company or HR and discuss the situation.","I would think that the experience was enjoyable.  It would be fun and interesting to be immersed in the clients culture and if I'm working with the client, I would enjoy being able to relate to the client on a more personal level.  Plus, I don't think it would be that hard of a culture to learn about compared to the U.S."
10459663815,I would talk with my colleague and let them know they can take the week. I would tell them it was ok because I'm willing to compromise with all colleagues including them. I would ask that if in the future I needed a vacation that they agree to do the same for me if both of us happened to need the same week in the future.,I would start working like crazy right then and there on the project. This would take stress off so I don't run right up to the deadline. I would let my boss know about this deadline and tell him/her any tasks they need please give to me as soon as they can so I can plan my tile accordingly.,"Ask colleague if it's because they have plans, or if they just don't have the urge to go. If no plans, I would try to sell the idea to them about possibility of future business. If they still say no, I go anyway.",I would pull out anything I have to prove negative feedback is wrong. I would meet with them afterwards. I would go over all my evidence and explain my feelings in a professional manner.,I would find it boring. I am not interested in culture of Norway. I am interested in my job.
10440105920,"I would consider if either one of us has actual plans for the vacation, like hotel reservations, flight plans etc... if they had plans and I did not then I'd be willing to alter my vacation dates.  If I had plans and they didn't I would present that to the supervisor and hope they would tell the other person they had to change their vacation dates.  If we both have plans then I think it would be fair to see who requested the time off first and give it to that person.",I would work on the project as much as possible and have it done ASAP given my light work load.  This way if my boss gives me any tasks to do it wouldn't interfere with my project plans too much.  If my boss gives me a task to do that would interfere with my project too much I would explain the situation and ask that maybe the task could be delegated to someone else.,I would attend the meeting to look good and dedicated to my job.  I would want to remain in good standing with the mentioned client.  I would look forward to meeting new people and possibly learning something.,I would be very annoyed and feel rather angry because the feedback is unfair and untrue.  I would present facts that support my argument that the negative feedback is untrue and undeserved.  If I did not reach an agreement with my manager I would present my argument to someone higher up until an understanding is reached.,I would volunteer to be involved in the project.  I would see it as an interesting learning experience.  By volunteering I also think it would make me look better from a manager's perspective.  It would be an enjoyable experience and I would learn something new.
10459700672,If I did not have plans set for my vacation time I would not mind taking a different week for my vacation. If I did have plans set that were unchangeable I would talk to my supervisor to show that I was unable to move my vacation time. Chances are I would not have plans and be able to move my vacation time with little to no issue.,I would spend my time delegating all my time between the current tasks I have to ensure that they were all taken care of. I would make sure to prioritise them in order of which ones were more important and which ones I could afford to slack on. That way the priorities were first and the lesser ones were not as concernable.,I would go anyways wether I knew someone there or not. I would be able to take responsibility for the company. It should not matter if I am the only one there I know or not.,"I would bring this up to his superior to try and get a resolution for it. If I legitmately deserve the feedback then I will accept it. However, if I do not deserve the feedback someone on the outside looking in would be the best bet.",I would enjoy this experience as it is fun to learn about a new culture and country. Wether or not I was able to travel wouldnt matter as long as I was able to learn something new. I think it would be fun.
10459661024,I'll go ahead and work it and be patient. To start nothing it's ok. I'll let people go before me. I always was that type of dude. Wait till last.,I will go ahead and do what my boss needed. I'll keep going on and moving on. I will handle all the job without complaints.,"I will still go. I don't wait on no man and no man hold me down. No man is not determining my faith or anything, but only my Most High God. It will be hard to go by myself but I will manage.",I would try to say nothing. I have a smart mouth but with knowledge. I will hate to use it towards them.,Boring I wouldn't like it because not interesting. The place sounds boring itself. No traveling is what really turned me off.
10462869614,I would first talk to find out why they cannot change their plans. Maybe it is the only time their family can get together. I would try to discuss matters and if it is worth trying to change their minds.,"I would try to get started on it early. Even though I have time, I want to make sure there are no major last minute changes that need to be made. I also would see if my boss needs any specific changes.","I would still go. Obviously, I want to make sure that I network with my largest client. I feel I can do fine by myself.",I would feel upset. I would talk to my supervisor. I would try to find out why I did poorly.,"I would find it enjoyable. I am hispanic. Therefore, it would be new and interesting."
10440097360,"I would try and talk to management and see who asked for the time off first. Then, I would go to HR and ask for their input. Then, I would talk to my coworker and find a solution, perhaps flipping a coin, or something.",I would start it right away. I would not delay it. I would finish it as soon as possible to prevent issues at the last minute.,I would probably convince him by buying him dinner. I would tell him to rest a bit and head for the meeting. I would tell him what is in store for him if we do go.,"I would escalate with higher management to review my work. I would tell them, with proof, why I do not agree with the feedback as it is not fair to me and my compensation. I would talk to my manager to find a solution.",I would volunteer for the project. I would like to learn a few things about the country and culture. I would seem dependable and eager to learn and participate.
10459865516,"I would have to consider where I'm taking my vacation to and who asked for the time off first. If I had been the first to ask for the days off, I would insist that I'm allowed those days. If I hadn't put them in early enough, then I would take my time and find a different week to move my vacation to.",I would set myself a goal to get the project done a week early. This would allow me time to adjust if I get loaded with stuff last minute and then I an handle that and know the project is done. I would likely still take time a few days before the due date to ensure the project is completed to my satisfacation.,"I would likely not go as I don't find networking meetings to be all that useful. Outside of meeting the largest client, who I'd likely only speak with briefly, there wouldn't be much for me to do. I would probably just go home and plan another way to talk to the client.",I would feel upset about this. If it's something I truly didn't believe in I would address it with my direct manager. If that lead no where I would bring it up to their manager to discuss the reasoning and show how my work didn't represent the negative feedback.,I would find this extremely enjoyable. It would give me the reason to study about something I'm unfamiliar with. I would likely dig deep into the information and learn as much as I could to help with pleasing the client.
10440118622,I would change my vacation plans to accommodate my coworker. I would do this to keep peace in the office and to show my supervisor that I am a team player. It would also be the Christian way to handle this situation.,"In view of my boss habit of springing last minute tasks on me, I would make sure that my project was done or nearly done. I would not want to be in a situation where my project would be delayed due to him springing tasks on me at the last minute. It would not be smart to do anything else.",I would probably go to the meeting. It would force me to make new contacts and be more outgoing. It would also make me stand out more with the company's largest client.,I would take note of the feedback and ask my manager for suggestions of how I may improve. I would also document the times when I thought the feedback was wrong during my work. It would be a constructive exercise for me and maybe show the manager that i was serious about improving.,"I would find it very enjoyable. I like history and culture, especially European. It would also open up opportunities to show my expertise in new avenues and also maybe gain a friend in the client from Norway."
10462911189,"It would depend on what I scheduled the vacation time for. If it is something I could reschedule or vacation time I scheduled just to take a break, I would reschedule for another week. If it was not something I could reschedule and especially if I had already put money into an actual vacation, I would make a plea to my boss.",Since my workload is light I would get started on this project right away. I do not like to procrastinate. I would want to be completely done with the project several days in advance and then I could easily accommodate any last minute updates or tasks.,I would go regardless because it is a large client. I would almost certainly not enjoy myself but I would act the part. I may try to convince my colleague into going.,I would be upset about this. If it was something I was able to prove is not true I would. Otherwise I would state my case and just try to show how valuable I am afterwards.,I would find this experience enjoyable. I really like learning about other cultures. I like getting to know people from all walks of life.
10459663825,I would absolutely consider changing my week and being the bigger person in this situation. By the way it's just vacation. There is no need in wasting precious energy worrying about this.. I would view this as if I get to take my vacation last while he will be back at work.,"I would get this project done immediately. It's not worth the hassle of waiting until the last minute to have to scramble something up. Besides, I like to hand in my best work and I can't do that if I'm waiting until the very last minute and rushing to get things done.","I would definitely be in attendance. That's what this is all about networking. If my colleague doesn't want to go that's on him, I certainly can't force him. But I won't let his decision influence me.","I would accept that this is the case whether I agree with it or not. I would take the information and use it to become better. Even if I didn't know exactly what to improve upon, I would improve upon everything.",I would find it enjoyable. I like learning new things and especially about new cultures. I would be even better if travel was involved.
10446150933,I would think that this is a no win situation if he is really that set in being inflexible. I would probably do my best to change my plans and just reschedule my vacation. I am pretty easy to get along with so that is what I would do but I would hope he pays it forward in the future.,I would not procrastinate knowing my boss throws things at me the last minute. I would take the 2 weeks I have and do what I know needs done and get it done as soon as possible. This would leave.me some needed time in case my boss likes up some extra work at the last minute. The key here is do not procrastinate,"I would first try to convince my colleague to go but if I failed at getting him to go I would have to consider what I would do. After much thought and weighing the pros and cons I would have to decide how important this client is to me personally. If he is very important for my success in making money I would have to go anyways. If the client isn't important to me making money I would probably stay home myself which is what I would prefer after a long, hard day at work.",In would have to ask him for a meeting to discuss with him why he felt that way and hope to change his mind. If I could not change his mind I would discuss the negative consequences his feedback could have for me and I would ask him for another chance. I would try to relate to him in a humanistic approach and hope he would give me a chance to show him I can do better. Constructive criticism could cause me to do better.,I would find this project intriguing. I think it would be fun to learn about this country and their culture. Although it is volunteer I would like at it as a way to expand my mind and let it be a learning experience. It just may come in handy one day.
10440099165,"I would see how important it is to me to take the vacation at that specific week. If it's not important, I will speak to my colleague and let them know that they can take it. I want to help my colleague if it's within reason.","I would try to time out the projects to see that I complete them all on time. If I cant, I'll speak to the manager about these tasks. I feel that voicing my concerns with my manager will help me handle the project.","I would attempt to convince my colleague for a bit. If I see they don't want to go, I'll likely go on my own. Since it's involved with work, I'll be more proactive about this meeting. I would go on my own and network with different clients.",I would feel really bad. This would cause me a lot of stress and make me think about my options. I would request to speak to my manager again and find the specifics about my negative experiences. I would voice my opinion and try to work towards a middle ground.,Learning a new language and culture sounds like fun. It's always good to broaden your horizons. I wouldn't be opposed to traveling either. I love to travel.
10446146957,I would try to work out a fair way for one of us to change our vacation time. It is not fair for me to be expected to back down. Flipping a coin would be the most fair way and if they don't agree I would have to talk to our boss about finding a fair solution.,"I would get the project started right away. Procrastinating can only lead to problems down the road. You do not know what lies ahead with your time. there could be a disaster that requires your attention and you haven't gotten this new project started yet, and now you are behind.",I would go by myself. If there is an opportunity to network with other clients it can only benefit myself by going. If I do not go my career will not advance.,"I would tell my boss that I will take the feedback, but I don't necessarily agree with it. I would tell my boss I would try to do better, but explain what you expect in return.",I would find the project a little dull. You can only learn so much about culture by reading in my personal opinion. If it involved traveling to Norway to embrace and experience the culture then I would absolutely find that enjoyable.
10459822014,"I would check to be sure that I have not already scheduled specific events for the week I had in mind. If so, I would attempt again to negotiate with my colleague. If not, I would try to find another time that suits the vacation I have in mind. Why not? I try to get along with my co-workers.","As with any deadline-based task I am confronted with, I would try to finish the project as early as I can. That way, I have time if it needs revision. Also, if the boss asks me to do extra work, I'm covered. My philosophy has always been: ""Don't be on time - be early.""","Regardless of what my colleague does, I would go to the meeting if it is my responsibility to do so. I have long since learned that it is not right to base my reactions or decisions on what others do or don't do. I might be a bit uncomfortable at first, but I want to do the right thing.","If I feel the feedback is wrong, I would tell the manager. If the manager will not listen, I would carefully summarize my points on paper and send it to a higher officer. It's not just a matter of losing the bonus, although that is a factor, but of doing the right thing.","I would find this experience exciting and enjoyable. I would be happy to learn a bit of the language and customs of Norway and would even welcome a trip to the country. I have visited Europe extensively in the past, and have had Norwegian friends and even girlfriends. They are wonderful people."
10440098918,"I would probably take it if I don't lose money on a deposit. If I lose money on a deposit we will flip a coin. If not, vacation dates can change.",I would get it done first. If I have a long term assignment than it is usually larger in scope. By handling this amidst the smaller tasks I can manage time better.,"Of course I would go. This is your bread and butter. If this is a networking meeting than my colleague is losing out. A year from now, these contacts will lead to business. The colleague will miss the opportunity.","This one is difficult. I would have to think on it. First, there isn't much info here. Is there an HR department?  If so, is there an appeal process. If not, is the manager in good standing with his superiors?  I would need more info before taking any action.",I absolutely would love it. Norway has a long and illustrious history and the culture is beautiful. It is one of the 'happiest' places on earth. Simply for the travel experience I would take it.
10459740633,"I would try to come to an understanding with my co-worker to get a better sense of his vacation schedule and plans, and to see how flexible they are in comparison with my vacation plans. If his plans are really unchangeable, and I have some flexibility, then I would change my vacation request. If we both have serious restrictions on our vacation plans, then we will need to come to a compromise. Perhaps splitting the week around the most important dates.","I would start the project ASAP. I'm not one to delay projects, regardless. I would pace myself to leave time for last minute assignments, and complete as much of the project as early as I can.","I would try to convince them to go. If they really are unable to go due to previous plans, then I would go myself. If it's an important meeting, we both should make an effort to go, so I would do my utmost to convince them of its importance, especially for such a large client.","I would try to analyze the feedback to make sure I'm clear on the criticism, and if I still feel it's unwarranted, I would re-engage my manager to have them more thoroughly explain their negative feedback. I would make a point of fully explicating my view of the feedback to show that there are perhaps aspects that he misunderstood, or was not aware of, that are misguiding his feedback. If it's still an issue, I would discuss it with another manager or higher supervisor.","I would very much be interested in volunteering for the project. I've always enjoyed learning about new cultures, languages, and countries. It would help break up the monotony of everyday tasks, and it would potentially help me in future work for this client, as well as possibly expanding my social and business contact network."
10459682550,i would Take a different week. I can move my vacation to a different week because I try to plan ahead.  Which means I get the time first then plan where and activities afterwards.,I would work on the project as dilligently as possible  its better to have time at the end then to take time and then find out you are late.  If I am aware that the boss gives last minute tasks this would be the best idea to do.,I would go to the meeting anyways because its my responsibility.  I dont care if I dont know anyone there as long as I dont miss important information about the client I will be ok,I would challenge this feedback and ask for more information as to why  then I would give my reasons why I think its not true.  I think its important to be able to stand up for yourself in the job world,I would find it enjoyable because I like researching other countries and why they are beautiful or not I also like to see the other side of countries and not just the tourist side of the country.
10440097623,"I would cede to my colleague. Being at the office is more important. That being said, I would ask my supervisor for a promise for future benefits. Maybe I can ask for an extra few days of vacation in exchange for the inconvenience.","I would do most of the work for this project immediately and anticipate my boss' decision. Doing most of the work would allow leeway in case additional work is piled upon me last minute. That being said, I would ask my boss if he is to anticipate any upcoming major work because he needs to be respectful of my labor as well.","I would still go to the event. My obligation is to represent the company and my group as best I can. Therefore I must attend this meeting just in case the big client needs my services. It doesn't matter if I don't know anyone there, I am sure they would be accommodating.","I would feel bad at first, just like any person would feel. But the most important thing is to get more details. I would then ask my manager on how to improve and ask if there is anything to redeem myself. Perhaps after some self reflection I would create a plan on how to bounce back. The bonus is a sunk cost; the most important thing is the future.","I would find this opportunity enjoyable. Even if it doesn't lead directly to a trip to Norway, it could lead to the potential for future business. Besides, I like to learn more about other cultures and am a good conversationalist and would find this task interesting."
10460017508,I would probably give in. In general I try to avoid confrontation at work if it can be avoided. I also think it is a good idea to 'bank up' good will in case it is needed later.,I would get as much finished up front as possible. I would also provide updates that indicate I am not as far along as I actual am. It would help to have her think that I have more work to do than I actual have to discourage last minute requests.,I would probably suck it up and go anyway. I try to stretch myself wherever possible. Knowing that my colleague won't be there and that somebody from the company should attend will make me feel guilty if I don't go.,I would be angry. I would also second guess my performance even though the evaluation was based on incorrect information. I would try to explain what I thought was wrong.,I would find it very enjoyable. It would be a great opportunity to do something out of the ordinary. It would also build my standing in the company and add to my professional experience.
10440098374,"I would try to understand my coworker's plans.  I would hopefully be able to change my plans.  Moving forward,  I would discuss my time off with my coworker","I would try to complete the project as early as I could.  If I can predict my boss giving me more work at the last minute, I would prepare for this.   I would try to do the project as much as I could before the due date.","I would try to convince my colleague to go for a short time.  It is important to network, and my colleague should understand.  Our largest client is important to us and going would show that.",I would feel pretty defeated about this.  I would try to talk to my manager about this feedback.  I would try to get other coworkers to talk to my manager about the job I'm doing.,I would find this enjoyable.  I love learning about new cultures.  It would probably light a fire in me to travel there.
10440154403,"I would first probably try to work it out with my coworker to see if there wasn't some sort of arrangement we could come to. If we couldn't come to an agreement, I would probably try my best to change my vacation schedule to a different week. I don't think I would press hard to make sure I got the week I wanted over my coworker, as in the long run it might create conflict.","I would make sure that I stay on top of the project. I would always do as much as could to make sure that I am advancing the project forward so that its complete well in advance (or as much as possible) before the deadline. In the event my boss gives me intense last minute tasks, I should then have ample time to fulfill them, with most of the project goals done and out of the way.","I would probably not want to go, however in the interest of at least one person from our company being with the client, I would find time to be there. I would make it clear to my coworker that I would do it this time, but I expect them to cover me next time, in the event that this type of situation occurs again. I would then go to the event and do my best to network and mix.",I would feel apprehensive about this. I would be worried that I'm being characterized incorrectly. I would want to further discuss the negative feedback with my manager to make sure that they have my view of events. I would possibly also try to get positive feedback from other coworkers to help make my case to my manager.,I would probably find this experience boring. It sounds like a lot of effort just to be involved in a work project. I would rather be involved in a project where I already had the appropriate knowledge and skills. I think it would be distracting for me to learn about a country just to get to know a client.
10440100268,"I would see who requested the week first and that should be the person who has to change.  If this is not something the parties are willing to work on, I would talk to my supervisor, and possibly, HR regarding my plans.  I think as long as I can change my vacation with no penalty, I would be flexible.","I would start to work on this project right away.  If I do not have much going on right now, begin to work on it and try to finish it early if possible to accommodate any additional job duties or requests.","I would talk to my colleague and try to find a way for both of us to go.  If he is not going, I would have a difficult time making the decision to go on my own.  I would look around to see if anyone else in the company is attending the meeting.","I would think about the situation and the feedback for at least one night.   I would then address the supervisor and try to work on a resolution.  If this does not happen, I would go to whoever would be the next contact on the supervisory roles.","I would find this experience very enjoyable and something I would definately volunteer to do.  I currently live in PA and have my whole life.  Travel is something I dream about but on a limited income, it is difficult.  A job requiring me to get out in the world would be amazing and I would feel honored to learn about the world and the cultures of the world."
10440112633,"I would immediately tell my boss and colleague that if I am not able to take my requested vacation, then I will quit. I would explain to them that it's unfair that I can't take a well needed vacation just because my coworker wants one. Also, I would question my boss as to why he believes it would be too busy at work if we both decided to take a vacation. Lastly, I would frankly tell them that I am not allowing my coworker to take a vacation at all and that I will not give in.","i would handle this project with great importance because while it is due in two weeks I believe i should get started right away. I should get started right away because it will allow me to not feel rushed if my boss unexpectedly gives me a last task assignment. Also, this would allow me to have more time to complete other assignments if I complete the current quickly.","I would not go tho the event simply because my collegiate isn't there. I would tell them I would not like to go because i may feel uncomfortable without having anyone there to talk to. Also, I would believe that there wouldn't be anyone there to introduce me to new people.",I would feel very angry at my boss because I feel that the feedback he gave me was wrong. I would immediately have a talk with him and ask specifically what areas did I perform poorly in. If I don't agree with his statement then I would tell him that I quit as his unfair evaluation practices would make feel that my job security is weak.,"I would defiantly find this experience enjoyable as ironically Norway is my favorite country. I would enjoy learning more about Norway and it's different customs as it will broaden my knowledge about the world. Also, I think it will only help me to understand and relate to the client ."
10459697769,I would change my plans. I would want to appear agreeable to my boss. I would want him to know that I was willing to be flexible. I think this would look good for me. I would also try to avoid conflict.,"I would try to get it done as soon as possible. If I have time now, I would try to get it off my plate. I would then not need to worry about it. If other last minute work came up I would be free to work on it.",I would go to it. Even though I am tired I think it would be good for my career. It would look good to my boss and the client. I think it could hurt me. Plus I like talking to people.,I would be extremely upset about it. I would probably be very mad at him and hate him. I would talk to him about what I could do to make it better. I would take strides to make it better so it doesn't happen again.,I think it would be enjoyable. I like learning about new things. I think that it is an interesting culture. It would be more interesting than the normal work.
10440169726,I would request my colleague to consider my plans if I had already booked the tickets for my vacation and apply for leave at a different time. I would consider altering my plans if I had not made any reservations. I would try to persuade my boss to take my side if I had asked him for the leave first.,I would talk to my boss and try to figure out if there were any pending tasks for the project. I would also talk to other employees involved in the project and try to help out if someone had too much work and was falling behind. I do not want a bunch on tasks to be dumped on me when the deadline is nearby.,I would request my colleague to accompany me since it is important for him to be present at that meeting.I would tell him that his absence would be noticed and give a negative impression to the boss. I would try to persuade him to extend the tiring day a bit longer to reap rewards in the future.,I would talk to my manager about the feedback and ask him why he gave me such negative reviews. I would try to sort out things with my manager if he had any issues with me. I would request him to give me a new review so that I could get my annual bonus.,I would find this experience enjoyable because it would be different from the mundane work at office. I would be enthusiastic to learn about the country and its culture. I would find this to be challenging and fun.
10440162616,I would try and find some diplomatic way to resolve the conflict. I would go to the co-worker directly and see if we could work it out. If that didn't work or we were at a standstill I would offer something arbitrary like a coin flip to decide. If that didn't work I would have to leave it up to the supervisor.,"I would make sure that it was almost ready to present a week ahead of time. That way I would have a good idea of what I was going to present but still have a little flexibility. I would approach it this way because of the experience I have with my boss tending to add things at the last minute, This way I would be prepared for anything.",I would still go to the meeting. Networking is always a good idea and I am not uncomfortable around new people. I would go and listen and try to absorb as much as I could while trying to make some new contacts as well.,First I would talk to the direct supervisor about it myself and be sure to have evidence or examples to support my point of view. I would also maybe try to talk to any other co-workers involved to get a third perspective. If none of that worked I would write a formal letter to his superior to request a meeting with all parties involved to explain the situation.,"I would find it interesting and probably enjoyable. I always like projects where I have to research another culture or learn about another peoples traditions. I would like to actually travel to the country though so I may lobby the company to send me there, claiming that I couldn't get a real feel for the culture unless immersed in it."
10459664091,I would talk to my family and explain that our initial time frame does dot work. I would then see if my spouse could get a different week off and ask my supervisor if I could have that time period instead. This would not be a huge concern since I do not book vacations prior to knowing we can attend.,I would immediately begin work on the project. I do not like having tasks hang over my head and would want to finish it immediately. This also would give me time to reflect upon my work and change things as needed.,I would first try to persuade my coworker to come for just a little while. I would explain the significance of the meeting and hope they reconsider. I would hesitantly go either way; this is something that could be monumental for my career.,I would take a day or three to really think about what my manager said. I would look for unknown similarities between their words and my work to make sure my instincts were correct. I would then write a list of upsetting key notes and ask for a further audience with clarification.,I would love this. Other countries and cultures fascinate me. I would hope that this opportunity tie a bond between the client and I and open up the door to company funded travel eventually.
10440111726,"I would reschedule the vacation. I wouldn't actually book hotels or make formal plans until I knew I had the time off, therefore it wouldn't be hard for me to move vacation by a week. This also might make me look like a better, more flexible employee.","I would try to work ahead as much as possible, so that I definitely have everything done by the time my boss gives me last minute tasks. I might also ask the boss earlier if they have anything else they would like me to do, so that I could try to get the ""last minute tasks"" before they are actually ""last minute."" Either way, though, I would find a way to get the work done.","I would feel reluctant, but would go. Even though I would be very tired, the opportunity to met one of my largest clients could lead to possible opportunities in the future. I feel I would regret not going more than I would regret going.","I would feel upset. I would probably argue a little bit, in the sense that I would ask for evidence of the feedback. I would ask my manager to explain in more detail why they feel that way. If they mention something incorrect (for example, wrongly thinking I hadn't submitted a project on time), I would correct them, and that would hopefully lessen the negative feedback.","I would find this enjoyable because I find it interesting, generally, to learn about other cultures. I would view it as a learning experience. I would probably volunteer if I had enough time to do that and my other work tasks."
10459698339,"It depends on the nature of the vacations. If one did not involve reservations in some way, and the other did, I would be likely to let the reservation one keep their time. However, if both circumstances are similar, whoever requested first should get to keep their time.","I would get started as soon as possible. I would probably prioritize everything and tackle the hardest or largest parts first, that way I have some leeway if I were to be assigned last minute tasks. I might also try to foresee what kind of tasks I may be assigned later, and make sure I'm prepared.","I would absolutely go anyway. It would be important for me to connect with the other client. My coworker's decision will have no effect on me putting myself out there, and it would be good for professional development and future promotions.","Well, if i disagreed with the feedback, I would definitely challenge it in the most professional way possible. I might eventually just give in if my boss doesn't budge on it. But I would try and provide some examples of things I've done that contradict what is being said. Honestly, if the negative consequences of untrue feedback were pretty significant, I'd be looking for another job.","I would find it enjoyable because I would get to be involved with people from very different backgrounds than myself. This could result in a unique opportunity for professional development, new ideas, and new ways of doing things. It would also possibly open some doors to adding more lines on my resume."
10459785137,"I would try to talk with my colleague about his vacation plans and see if they are too set in stone to change. I would then try to see if there was any way we could come to a compromise around changing the dates. If not, I would ask for the colleague to give me the choice next time something like this comes up around time off.",I would handle this project by getting it done sooner than later. Knowing I could get last minute tasks from my boss that take a lot of time I don't want to be scrambling to finish the project on time. I would do my best to get the project done on time so I would have the extra time to do the other tasks my boss needed me to do.,I would try and convince my colleague to attend the networking event with me. I would tell them that I don't know anyone there and really need some support while attending. I would hope that they would want to be of help and decide to attend the networking event with me.,I would ask my manager for a time to sit down and discuss the feedback he gave me. I would do my best to explain my side of things and have an open discussion where my voice could be heard. I would then hope my manager would see things differently and we could come to an agreement on how things were going in regards to his feedback.,I would find this experience enjoyable. I would like to learn more about the country and culture of Norway because it would be different and interesting. Learning this would give me a better understanding of my client's culture and country so that I would be better prepared for the project we would be doing with our new clients.
10454409896,"I would speak with my colleague and my supervisor about the situation. I would want to understand why my colleague is unwilling or unable to change his/her plans. If my colleague had a good reason for being able to shift his/her plans, but I could easily move my plans I would. Otherwise, I'd try to negotiate so that I could still take my vacation as planned.",I would try to structure my working hours so that the project was due ahead of schedule in order to account for any last minute tasks that arise.,"I would go to the meeting if it was important that my organization have someone present to maintain the client relationship. If there isn't a benefit to me or my organization, I would likely skip the networking event as well.","I would be unhappy in the moment when I received that feedback, but I would still try to act professionally. I would seek to clarify the feedback with my manager to better understand how they arrived at the erroneous conclusion and to see if there is anything I can do to correct any incorrect perceptions that others have about me.","I would find this experience enjoyable. I don't know much about Norway, but I would enjoy learning more about the country and culture. I'd be interested in traveling as well if possible."
10459851537,"I would only be willing to change my vacation week if I had not invested much into this vacation week. If I had paid money for travel already, or if I had made extensive plans with someone, then that would make me less willing. If I had nothing I cared about going on that week, I would be willing to switch.","I would try my best to handle the project while the workload is light. I do irrationally procrastinate things sometimes, so there is no guarantee I would succeed. If a last minute task were assigned, the project would be harder to complete along with it closer to the due date.","I would likely not go, as I am not always good with people on my own and would have potential to due more social damage. If I was feeling particularly confident leading up to the meeting, then I would be more willing to go. It all depends on whether I think I'm likely to get more benefit from going then not.","I would feel injustice in this situation, and address my concerns with the manager. If the manager was not open to my concerns, I would weigh the costs and benefits of taking my concerns up the chain of command. Doing this could potentially put me in a worse situation with the manager.","I would find this experience enjoyable. I love learning about different countries and culture, and it would not even feel like work. If there was an opportunity to travel with the project I would definitely take advantage of that as well."
10440098975,I would let whoever asked for it first have the time off. That is only fair. So I would reschedule mine if I asked later.,i would start on it as soon as possible. I would dedicate a lot of time to it. I would get it done as quick as possible.,I would go make an appearance. After saying hi I would casually leave. That way I get the best of both worlds.,I would refuse to sign anything. I would document everything. I would go above my manager if I needed too.,I would like it. It would be fun to learn about another culture. I would also hope to travel there as well.
10446120006,"I would be willing to change my vacation plans this time if the other person is not. However, they would owe my a favor. Next time, if we had problems with scheduling, they would have to yield and I would get first dibs on the time away from work, and they would need to change.","I would get the project done right away. With it done, I would be able to not worry about if I can get it done with additional work. Furthermore, with it done, I would be able to do extra projects and give them all of my attention and make sure they are done right.","I would definitely go to the meeting. If you truly want to advance you career, you have to make sacrifices to make sure that you get where you need it to. It wouldn't matter if you didn't know anyone else there, you can meet other people and network and make connections. These could help later in your career.",I would ask for more clarification about the information. I would organize a meeting with the manager to go over my performance and analyze my work. I would then ask about how I could improve and what would need to be done improve overall department positive feedback.,"I would find the experience enjoyable. Norway is a fascinating country and learning more about it could be fun and entertaining. Even if you don't go on a work trip to the country, it would still help you to understand and work more extensively on the project and contribute more as a whole."
10440113309,I would just change my vacation date. I would not want to ruin my colleagues plans. It would not be worth the conflict.,I would get done as much as I could early. I would do this to ease my mind because I stress when I have an upcoming deadline. I would also do this because I might have a last minute task.,"I would try to persuade them to go with me. If they wouldn't, I would go alone out of obligation even if I didn't want to. It would be too important to miss.","I would accept the feedback and try to work on things that my manager mentioned. Although I disagree with the feedback, I would still try to improve on what was said. I would not become argumentative about it.",I would find it enjoyable but also stressful. I would be nervous to be out of my comfort zone on this type of project. I would like learning about something foreign to me.
10440097866,"I would keep my vacation time. Apparently, I had my vacation in first.  So, I think they are the one that needs to change their time not me. If they needed that time for something important then they should have put in their time sooner.","I would work on this project as much as I can. This way maybe I could finish this project before my boss gives me a new project. I like to be done on time and maybe if I get finished early, I could have a moment to catch up on things.",I would go to the meeting. There I could meet new people. I could get new opportunities that my colleague will miss out on. I could make new friendships that can last a lifetime.,I would work harder and correct this issue. I would first talk to my boss and see how he thinks I need to do better. I would go above and beyond to prove that I can do this and I am good at it.,I would love to do this. I like to learn new cultures and facts about Norway. I would even try to learn their language so I could make them feel welcome to our company.
10459871523,I would be willing to take a step back and let them have the vacation week as long as I didn't have concrete plans.  I am easy going and it doesn't bother me much to change plans.,"I would work my project to the best of my ability to try and meet my deadline.  If I receive these last minute tasks to complete and am in jeopardy of not making my deadline, I would reach out and ask for help.","If they do not go, I will go either.  this would be based solely on a personal decision as I have bad anxiety in large crowds of unfamiliar people.  I would surely have a panic attack.",I would request a one on one meeting with my manager and have a discussion to see if we can see each others' viewpoints.,I think that I would find this boring because I enjoy repetition and am very weary of change.  It would be difficult for me to concentrate on my tasks while trying to learn about another country.
10460073425,"I would think about whether I've covered for my colleague previously, and whether I've covered for them at my supervisor's request. I'd also consider whether I could change my vacation or not, because if it didn't really matter to me, I'd be fine w/ changing my plans. And if needed, I'd be open to splitting the difference (moving mine a few days, they'd move theirs a few days) with my colleague, or saying I'd move this time but I want it memorialized in email and wherever else, so that next time I get first pick.","I'd ask my boss for a check-in meeting so I can update her on the project. At the meeting, I'd ask her how things are going with her, and if she's got anything percolating that she'd like me to take off her plate now or in the next day or so, because I know sometimes she likes to pass things off to me, and I'd like to plan it out with her. I'd casually say that I know she's really busy, and I want to make sure I can both give the client what they need with my big project and make sure I have enough time to support her as well.","I would go to the networking meeting. I wouldn't be thrilled at the last-minute notice, of course, and would talk to the person who notified me about it later (ask how I can help them ensure I get earlier notice, if at all possible). At the meeting, I'd make sure I meet people from the big client, make sure my boss sees me there, and try to have a fun and productive time. I'd also try to google some of the client-people sure to be there, if I have that info beforehand.","I'd give it a little time to let it settle - so I'd have time to really think about it and feel my feelings. I'd think about what I want to say, and prep notes with that info. I'd request a sit-down with my boss, and say that I'd like to hear more from them about their concerns and ask for examples of what they said so I can improve (and also to see if these are genuine issues with my work, or them not agreeing with an approach that is still valid, for example). I'd ask what concrete things they have in mind for me to do, and also ask for more info about what positive things they've observed. I'd then present a plan for improvement.","I'd find it enjoyable. I have a curious mind, and am always researching, drawing connections between things, asking questions, etc., so learning those things in order to better serve the client is right up my alley. It's usually part of my job to research, fashion info into a presentation/article/meeting agenda/seminar, and present it to others, so this is definitely a thing I'm good at and would like to do. And I'm already interested in Norway, too."
10459978224,I would let my supervisor know that I would change my vacation week. It would not be worth it to get in an argument over it with my colleague. I would also hope to look like the bigger person in my supervisor's eyes.,I would try to get it done as soon as possible. I don't like to procrastinate. Then I would not be stressed towards the end.,"I would not go. I really don't like social situations, especially where I don't know anyone. I would be too uncomfortable.",I would definitely go and talk to my boss about it. I would let them know why I felt the feedback was unfair.,I would find it enjoyable. I enjoy learning about different cultures. It seems like it would be fun and something different
10440100166,"If there were consequences for my deposits and such, I would call a meeting to discuss it with my boss and coworker.  I would let them know that it would cause me financial loss to have to change my plans.  If there were no chance of financial loss, then I would be accommodating, but ask for a week that was really important to me so that I could go somewhere special during the off-season and take advantage of lower rates and smaller crowds.","I would accept the responsibility knowing that whatever I needed to complete the task I would be able to create.  I'm not concerned about what the boss would or wouldn't do because I would be focused on the project, it's completion and my being shielded from unnecessary distractions.  If the boss has confidence that I can do it, then I will do it without hesitation or doubt.","I would first try to convince my colleague to go because the meeting is important to our company.  If I could not convince him, I would go anyway and see it as an opportunity for growth.  I would go out of my way to be engaging and receptive to the clients.  I would take the position that these are my guests and I would treat them as someone I invited into my home.",I would immediately schedule a meeting with the boss to discuss the feedback to see if there was a way to change his mind.  I would be prepared to bring with me any corresponding evidence that would back up my position.  I would elicit from the boss what exactly it is that he thinks I did and what it is that he wants me to do.  I would remind him of the consequence for me and how important it is that I resolve the issue quickly and to his satisfaction.,"I have an endless curiosity about the world, the people and places.  I would immediately step up to volunteer to take the position so that I could get paid to learn more about Norway and it's people.  I would actually lobby for travel time so that I could experience the country first-hand and validate the information that I'd read."
10442517053,"I would reschedule my own vacation. Clearly, if they're so worried about not having to change the date of their vacation, then I don't really have any other choice. I'm not a person who like conflict, so I wouldn't start anything. I would just work around it.","I would try to work ahead of schedule. I would put extra effort into being prepared for whatever last minute tasks my boss may have for me, as well. I don't want to be blindsided by a slow beginning.","I would tell my colleague that I understand if they don't want to go and I don't want to pressure them, but to ensure that their answer is final. I don't want to bail out because I think they won't be there only for them to show up. And I also don't want to go alone because they say they'll be there and never show up.","I would feel upset about this situation. However, I wouldn't let that stop me from trying to improve. I would arrange to have a personal meeting with my manager to discuss how I can improve with little or no reprucussions to my job.","I would find this experience enjoyable, personally. I love learning about the culture, language, and lifestyles of those in other countries. Being able to do that while working actually sounds like a blast."
10459697552,"I would just let my colleague take their vacation. To me, It's not worth fighting over, especially if someone is set in their ways on something. And as you said, my colleague won't be willing to change, It's a headache to deal with. I can just take a vacation some other time in the year.","I would try to work on it early and collect my overall idea and theme for the project within the first few days. Due to real past experience, I've learned that hindering projects or work due never turns out good, last minute rushing is stressful and doesn't display your best work. I would do my best to get most of it done the first week, and then just change what comes to my head or when new ideas sprout the second week. Plus, I'd be more prepared for extra tasks from my boss.","In reality, I probably wouldn't go. Deep down I'm kind of shy, and It's hard for me to network myself when I don't know anybody, especially in a work environment. I would probably just go home since It's a long day I had at work, and work on my goals or relax and get something done.","If I truly felt the feedback was a lie, or going against me, I'd try to at least back myself up. It can be hard in a situation like this, but I have to hold my dignity and self worth. I've learned through life you can't let people put you down, you gotta stick up for yourself you're all you have. And if it went wrong, worse comes to worse I get fired or quit and find a new job. I'm not going to stress about it.","I'd find it enjoyable personally. I think it's always good to learn about other ways of life and how things differ throughout the world. We only have one short life on earth, It's good to take in all the ways of life and how humans have evolved and live in these days. I'd do it if I had the chance."
10459706468,"I would be willing to change my plans. If they're not willing to, I'll be the bigger man. It'll reflect nicely on me.","I would start on it immediately, and get it done. I would double check with my boss there's nothing else he needs done. I will go out of my way to ensure it's done right.","I would be willing to go by myself. I'd just stay for a while and introduce myself. After that, I'd head home to get some rest.",I would take some time to think about what he said. I would approach him later to try to talk about it.

If it was them that requested first, I would pick another time off. It's not convenient, but it's fair.","I would start working on the project now, and finishing as soon as I can. That way, if it's ""done"" and I find something to correct, it's not a big deal. Additionally, sometimes things take longer than anticipated, so waiting can significantly backfire. Working on it now is good for me, the project, and everything in between.","I would go. Networking is important in the professional world, and this is a large client. Not only do I want to improve my relationship with them, but network for future possibilities.","I would take the feedback and do what I can with it. Sure, I may not agree with it, but perception is truth to that person. If my manager sees that I'm doing something incorrectly, I need to make it apparent that I'm doing it how they want.","I would definitely find this enjoyable. It would be more enjoyable with travel, but learning a client's culture can be fun. I think it improves relationships and creates a special bond."
10459805609,I guess it depends if mine was planned for a trip that I couldn't get money back on or change. If I was able to change I would try to. I would do what I could to make sure one of us was able to take their planned vacation time instead of us both losing out or losing a job.,I would try to work as fast and efficiently as I could to make sure I got the project done on time. I would ask help from other people if needed so that I could focus on the project. I would also possibly ask other employees if they were free to help me with the project.,I would definitely try my best to go. Even though I wouldn't know anyone it would be good for my company that I went. I would want to impress our client instead of no one showing up or at least not me.,I wouldn't argue with my manager. I would try and change what feedback they gave me by improving. Even if I didn't do these things wrong I would want to show her that I can do them and make her see me for who I really am.,I would find this experience extremely enjoyable. I would love to introduce our culture to someone else. I would also enjoy possibly learning about theirs as well in this process.
10459890784,I would talk to my colleague and ask what they plan on doing on their vacation.  If they have plans that they cannot back out of I would be willing to change.  If they are not doing anything special I would ask if they would change their vacation.  I would also ask if they would be willing to split the days with me so we could both have some days off that week.,I would try and get the project done quickly just incase something comes up.  I would work on it during my free time only though just making sure that something is done everyday at least.  I would also ask my boss if there was anything coming up that I needed to be aware of because I had to have time to finish the project.,I would ask my colleage to at least come to the meeting for a short time to at least introduce me to a few people.  If they were not willing to that I would at least ask them to tell me about some of the people that they know so I could talk to them and tell them that I work with them.  I would try my best to get them to cooperate with me on one of those plans.,I would confront my manager and ask why the negative feedback was given and how they came about it.  I would ask that they work with me to make the feedback turnaround and work out into something good for me.  I would be very upset but act professional about the whole thing.,I would find this enjoyable because it is something new and different.  It would be a good opportunity to meet and help someone out.  It would also make me look good for doing it.
10459660434,I would change my plans. I am a person who is always willing to compromise. I would be the bigger person and let them have their way. It would not affect me in any way to have a different week.,I would immediately start on the project. There is no sense in procrastinating knowing a last-minute task may come up. This is the route that would cause me less stress on the long run.,I would go to the meeting. The purpose is to meet new people and I am up for the task. I consider myself social and would have no problem adjusting.,"I would consult with the manager in how I could improve in the area. I would feel defeated somewhat, and would try to never make the same mistakes again. I would be very mindful of my performance moving forward.",I would definitely be up for thevtask. I think the experience would be enjoyable and educational. I would be expanding my knowledge of the world and getting paid.

Now I'm female. if the other employee is a make - I'm focked becuase the male will always get more consideration than a female. Sorry. I'm bitter.","I always, always do as much work up front as I can as soon as I can. I never worry about 'running out of work"", as a field tech, on slow days I would call on others to take a call from them. This worked out great because dinglewood dumped 23 calles that were a week old all at once on me and he's not sick he's in training classes. The bastard..

I asked him and he said it was the way I dressed. I wear white shirt, gray pant suit. I say perhaps you should go shopping with me to pick out clothes. I asked him what do I have on now that  bothers him. He says, ""You can lose the purple socks."" I reply I supposed you prefer me to have white underwear?  He says ""yes"", I lost that round. Didn't get better than a 3 (IBM 1989)",Yes! Yes! I would LOVE to do this. I love learning new languages and people! I would even try out that stinky fish that you can smell 5 miles away!  Hopefully I wouldn't have to travel in the dead  of winters. But I would do it.
10440175045,"I would talk to my colleage and ask what their plans are, to see if and why they couldn't change their plans. If I had plans I could change, I would do that. It sounds like I asked for the week of first, so I may not change my plans.","I would immediately begin working on this project, since my boss usually gives me last minute tasks. I would rather be ahead of the game with this task in case another gets thrown in my lap.","I would still go, as it is a networking meeting, so I would be able to meet people i normally don't interact with. I could meet new clients, or new friends. Networking could lead to endless possibilities.","I am irritated about the situation. I would talk to my manager to get clarification. I would explain my stance, and why I don't believe it is true.

It creates less workplace drama and doesn’t form any bad blood between me and my coworker.","I would make sure not to slack off and give myself the appropriate amount of time for both this project and potential new workloads from my boss. It is important at my job to make sure that I can handle any workload thrown my way and meet all of their deadlines. I would make sure to keep in communication with my boss as well, to ensure I know exactly what needs to be done at all times. This helps me do well at my job and secure my job.","I would try to convince them to go because it is important for their career to. Though if they decide not to go, I still would. It’s better to push myself outside of my comfort zone if it means i can advance my career (potentially). Also I could meet new people.","I would speak with my manager personally to figure out what I’ve done wrong or where things went wrong in my work. A true manager should always be willing to do so for their employees. I would do this because it is essential for me to know how I can improve, and to make sure the review was actual honest feedback from my manager and not something they’ve crafted on purpose. Either way, it will help me understand what needs to be improved to avoid consequences.","I would find it super enjoyable because it gives me the opportunity to learn more about another country and their culture. In order to understand a client and get them to return, it’s important to understand where they’re from and their ways of living as well. Where someone is from and how their country works politically, economically, etc. most certainly has an impact on their buying & business habits."
10459985088,"I would try to see if my vacation plans could be changed. If the other employee is unwilling to change their plans, that's the only thing I could do. Otherwise, I could put in for the same week and let the manager decide who gets the week off. Either way, I still might have to change my plans.","I would start the project right away and work on it whenever I have time. This way, if the boss gives me more work, I'll have been working on the project all along. I'd be more likely to finish the project on time.","I would still go to the meeting, even if my coworker doesn't go. It's an important meeting, and I feel I would have to go. If it's one of my clients, then I would know the clients, so I would know someone other than my coworker.","I would talk to the manager above them. I would tell the higher up manager how I felt about the feedback, and why it wasn't true. I would ask for their help in mitigating the damages.","I would find it enjoyable. Exploring new cultures is fun for me. I would not be bored, and I might even volunteer if there was traveling involved."
10446118370,"Try to reason with him or come to an agreement. Maybe he has plans that he can't just change, like airline tickets or a cruise. If I had to, I probably wouldn't mind moving my vacation week.","I would probably work as fast as I could to get the work done. If it's a light load of work, I could probably squeeze in some free time in those days, just in case my boss requires additional assistance.","I would try to convince my colleague to come with me. I would offer a solution of staying for just a little while to try and meet a couple of people. But if I couldn't persuade my colleague to accompany me, I would probably go by myself, because it might be a great chance to get my work out there.","I would try to chat with the manager who gave me the feedback to see if I could improve. If I really felt that it was truly biased and unfair, I would try to get feedback from other managers or people in the company who can attest to my performance.","I would rather enjoy that experience. I'd like to meet someone from a different culture and teach them a little bit about my own, and maybe even expand my horizons and learn a bit about theirs."
10459659253,If I didn't have anything planned for the week except sitting at home I would switch.  if I had already planned something and asked off first then I would still take off.,I would try to get it done as quickly as possible.  Due to the fact that my boss comes up with other tasks at different times.  I would try t prioritize the projects on what is needed to be done first.,I would probably not go as well.  If it is after having a long day at work last thing I want to do is go to another work function.  especially since y friend wouldn't be there.,"if it carries a consequence of my losing money, I would try t appeal the feedback.  I would defiantly contact a superior above my boss.",I would definatly want to learn something about the new country.  I think it would defientatly be enjoyable.  learning something new everyday is great.
10459912983,"I would move my vacation plans. It seems like my coworker's plans are set and cannot be changed. So I would try to move my week to another time, so that my supervisor has one of us on vacation at a time.","I would start to work on the project. I would make a list of what needs to be done and when each item needs to be done by. That way, I can plan out some extra time in the schedule for any last minute tasks that might arise.","I would go to the networking meeting. Even if my colleague isn't going to be there, I feel that this would be a good opportunity to meet other people. Also, the point of networking isn't to go with friends or coworkers, but to meet other people.",I would explain to my manager why I don't agree with the feedback. I would show them examples of how I did good things. I would focus on the positives instead of the negative feedback.,"I would find this enjoyable. I enjoy learning about other cultures. And maybe one day, I would enjoy visiting the country and learning even more."
10462864423,"I would be willing to compromise for another week, but only if I hadn't made important plans. I also would speak with my supervisor about how to make sure that in the future I would not have to change my plans based on a misunderstanding. I would also have a polite conversation with my colleague and let him/her know my position and where I stand on the situation. If other problems came about I would probably contact someone in HR or another superior.",I would go ahead and start on the project and try to get it out of the way. This would ensure that if my boss did ask me to take on any last minute tasks that I wouldn't risk not getting the project done on time or having to take on a heavy workload. It would probably also be best to map out all of my tasks and to make sure that I don't leave any work undone.,"I would try to encourage my colleague to go. If for some reason my colleague chose not to go I would probably still go so that I didn't miss the opportunity to win over an important client. Sometime to get something you never had, you have to do something you never did. It would be a new experience, and maybe even a scary one, but I'll never know unless I take the chance.","I would talk it over with my manager and see what changes I can make. Sometimes you have to receive constructive criticism and even if you don't agree just take it as learning lesson. I would also ask about evidence supporting the negative feedback, and if found to be accurate,  apologize and vow to do better.",I would find this experience enjoyable. I love learning about new  cultures and lifestyles different from my own. It would also put me in a good position with the company to take on this volunteer role. I think it would be an amazing opportunity.
10462958549,"If my vacation plans were flexible I would change them.  If not, I would discuss with my coworker to see what the reason was they would not change.  If their plans were not flexible either, I would discuss with my supervisor to see if we could come to a compromise - maybe each of us could do some work while on vacation.",I would begin working on the project as soon as I receive it.  Given that my other work is light and I may be getting last minute tasks I would want to work on the project due in 2 weeks so I would be able to complete it fully in time for the due date.  I would work on the other daily work in addition to be sure everything was completed.,Most likely I wouldn't go either if my coworker wasn't going.   I don't like social situations like that and would definitely be uncomfortable going alone.  I may ask to see if another coworker was available to go and if not I would not attend.,"I would express my views to my manager and be sure to submit them in writing as well.  If it was something I could prove did not occur, I would document the facts.  If my manager was not willing to change the feedback and it would affect my bonus, I would contact HR and discuss.",I think it would be an enjoyable experience.  I would like to learn about new countries and cultures and would find it interesting.  I would not want to travel but think it would be fun to learn some new things.
10459714000,I would stand aside this year and next year put in my request earlier. It's better to be gracious.,I would complete earlier to ensure extra time is available for extra tasks that could interfere with completing the project on time. I would actually improve the project if time allowed. Better safe than sorry.,"If I love my job, I would go. Otherwise, I might risk it and not go. A job is not my whole life. It depends on how tired I was.","I would feel it is unjust. I would also realize my supply depends on God, not man. I would not seek to change the manager, but review my performance and improve if necessary.",I would find it enjoyable. I know little about Norway. It is an opportunity for adventure intellectually.
10440097968,I would change my vacation plans assuming I do not have anything booked. I would let my colleague take that week of vacation. I would hope that they would be willing to make a sacrifice for me in the future because I am taking one for the team in this situation,I would try and finish the task as quickly as possible so if another project was given at the last second I could handle it. I would try to finish it quickly instead of rationing it over the course of the two weeks. I would make sure I do not get overwhelmed with work because of a last second assignment,I would try to convince my colleague to go with me because it is important for work. If he did not want to go I would make up an excuse as to why I could not go such as something related to my kids. I would try to avoid going without offending the clients and attempt to reschedule for another day,"I would express my concerns with my manager. I would give counterpoints as to why I believe my work is satisfactory. I would tell him that I am concerned about my bonus, and try to come to a compromise about future work activities. I would explain that I do not think I am doing bad work, but am concerned about my bonus and am willing to change",I would find this experience incredibly enjoyable. I have always wanted to go to a Scandinavian country because I find the culture very interesting. I would love to volunteer for the project because I think it would be very enjoyable
10440165901,I would try and make another vacation time. I would allow my colleague to take her vacation but I would let her know that she owes me one. I would get her to agree that next time I get priority on the vacation time.,I would definitely get going on the project immediately and act as if it was due in 2 weeks. This way I would make sure to have time to complete this project and also have time to do extra work for the boss. I could also just ask the boss to allow me to complete this project first before doing others things. I would ask him in advance.,I would beg her to please come with me. I would explain that I do not know anyone there and really need her help because this is such a great networking opportunity with a big client. I would offer to bake her some cookies or take her to lunch if she came with me just for a little while. Just enough time to introduce me around.,I would ask for a meeting with my boss and discuss my disagreements with him. I would try and defend my side in a very humble way and try to see it from his perspective as well. If he is right I would accept and let him know that I will learn from the experience and assure him that it will never happen again.,I would find it rather boring if I was not able to travel to the country. I prefer to be there and experience the culture rather than just read about it. But if my company really needed my help I would definitely do it but it would not be enjoyable.
10440167915,"I would try to get more information about my colleague's vacation plans first. For example, if he/she has non-refundable plane tickets or has children counting on this trip I would be sympathetic and change my plans. On the other hand, if the colleague was just being a jerk, just not wanting to budge over it for no real reason, I'd stand firm insisting I get that week off.","I would try my best to pencil in time for unexpected delays. Knowing my boss sometimes does this, I'd go into it assuming he would and budget time accordingly. So I'd really try to get as much done as soon as I can therefore anything extra that comes up doesn't throw me too badly.","I would lean towards not going. While this would be a good opportunity for me, it would be really stressful if I don't know anyone there. I'm very introverted, so it would be difficult for me to go into that sort of environment, especially alone.",I would remain calm and explain why I respectfully disagree with the feedback. I'd try to use verifiable facts to back up my claims as well as try to explain any mitigating factors that may have affected my performance. The whole point would be to try to get my manager to see things from my point of view.,"I would love it! Having done a lot of international travel in my life, I would find learning about and working with someone from another country enjoyable. It would be a learning experience for me and I'd be excited about it. I would certainly volunteer."
10459802247,"Depending on the level of importance of my time off, I would be more than willing to switch vacation days if he was willing to do so for me in the future if the same situation were to arise.","I would do little bits of the project at a time from the second it was first assigned to me. If other tasks were handed to me, I'd be able to handle both workloads when the time for the big project was due.",I would probably still attend either way just to show some initiative. I think it's important to be present at those kinds of meetings to show you care.,"First and foremost, I would ask him why he feels negatively about my work and what can be done so this does not happen again in the future. I would try to gain understanding with him. I would also try to see what consequences can arise and if there is anything I can do to avoid them.",I would do whatever is assigned to me. I don't believe I would find the experience enjoyable or boring. I don't think I would find it to be something I would be jumping for joy over.
10459659619,"I would ask for further information regarding my colleague's vacation plans and then compare their plans to mine.  Things like non-refundable airfare, hotels, and resorts should be considered.  Also, if the plans include visiting sick family or such that should be considered as well.  If any of these things are at play then I would argue that the other person should yield their vacation plans.  If they are not at play, then the boss should make the decision if neither one of us will forgo their plans.","I would go ahead and try to complete most, if not all, of the project ahead to time.  I would do this so that if I was given additional work near my deadline then I could complete my original project on time.  I would not go to my boss with my completed project too soon or I would be inviting him/her to assign me additional work.","If I was truly interested in networking I would go without my colleague.  However, if networking wasn't right on my list at the time I would go home.  I might also wish to use this meeting as a chance to expand my contacts within the company.  If that was the case I would go without my colleague.",I would be upset by the situation.  I would try to talk to my boss the feedback.  If there was some reason for my unsatisfactory work I would explain it to the boss.  I would inquire about what I needed to do to improve my work and make every effort to do so before any annual bonuses were determined.,I would find the experience enjoyable.  I would like to learn more about Norway.  If things changed and I was able to travel to Norway I would be better prepared.  I would not like to travel to a country that I knew little to nothing about.  I like to be prepared.
10452480808,"I would talk to my colleague and try and understand where they are coming from and their reasoning for why they are not being flexible. Perhaps I would get a better understanding why they think they should be able to take their vacation and not you. It doesn't seem like a very considerate approach from the colleague to try and bully me around. Ultimately, I may have to reach out to our supervisor to see if they will intervene and help us decide who would be able to take their vacation and who wouldn't be able to.",I would try and do the lion's share of the work leading up to the due date so that if need be I could pivot and help out with the last second tasks that seem to creep up. If I'm ahead of the game I won't get frustrated and overwhelmed. I'll have some availability so I can help my boss out.,I would probably suck it up and help my colleague out. Perhaps next time when both of us are tired he or she would be able to take one for the team the next time this situation arises. I'm not super outgoing so in general I would prefer to not have to entertain clients unless I had a personal relationship with that individual.,"I would be pretty upset that I wasn't being treated fairly. How could I not be? I would ask my supervisor for specific, observable behaviors of mine that speak directly to his or her negative feedback. Having these types of examples would either provide understanding of where I'm coming from or support my notion that they are untrue.","I think that would be pretty exciting. I enjoy traveling in general, however, when its for work that could be a bit of a chore. I like learning things about new cultures and Norway would be pretty interesting. Scandinavian countries are pretty cool. Hopefully, I would be able to travel during the summer months. LOL."
10460255307,I would change my vacation time.  I would do this because I know that I just want time off and the time frame isn't as important to me.  i would also remember this and not help my colleague out later on.,I would begin work on the project immediately.  I like to get things done as soon as possible to be prepared for any last minute tasks or changes that need to be made. I would rather be done ahead of time than wait until the last minute.,I would attend the meeting ebcause it could lead to better progress with a large client down the road. I would also encourage my colleague to go with me to assist in making it a better experience for us both. I would also attempt to make sure I let the client know how important their business was to me at the meeting.,I would address this with my manager and ask for how he arrived at that assessment. I would also see if there was another reason for a negative feedback. I would also address this with my manager's supervisor if I still felt i was being wronged.,I would find this boring without any travel.  I would like to be able to travel to truly learn about the culture of  Norway.  I would not want to learn abotu a country I would never go to.
10440100386,I would volunteer to take the next week off after my colleague has returned. I would be very understanding of his/her situation. It may be more important than mine.,"When the task is given, I will immediately start on it as soon as possible. No matter how long the task will take, I will give my full attention to the task and make sure it is completed on time. During the time, I will eliminate any distractions and focus all my attention to the task.",I would feel a little left out if my colleague won't go with me. I will try to convincing first. I understand that I am a strong person and can accomplish the networking meeting by myself.,"I would feel very sad and mad about the situation. A negative feedback will only cause negative emotions but if I choose to take the negative feedback and learn from it, I think I will be okay. It is also important have a one on one talk with my manager so that we are on the same page moving forward and it will not hurt the company or my annual bonuses.","I would find this experience very enjoyable because learning about another country and their unique culture are some of my favorite things to do. Gaining background knowledge of its culture can be comforting while working on the project. Never stop learning, always continue to have an open mindset is the best positive thing to have."
10440103001,"I WOULD SUGGEST A COMPROMISE.  I WOULD BE WILLING TO LET MY COLLEAGUE HAVE THAT WEEK IF THE NEXT TIME IT COMES UP TO PICK VACATION TIME, I GET FIRST PICK AND IF WE BOTH WANT THE SAME WEEK, I WOULD GET IT.  DEPENDING ON HOW WELL THE COLLEAGUE AND I GOT ALONG WOULD DEPEND ON WHETHER OR NOT I WOULD REQUIRE IT IN WRITING.",I WOULD GET THE PROJECT DONE AS QUICKLY AND EFFICIENTLY AS POSSIBLE.  WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF MY BOSS GIVING ME EXTRA TASKS THAT COULD TAKE UP ALOT OF MY TIME IT IS IMPORTANT TO GET THIS PROJECT DONE AND OUT OF THE WAY SO THAT IF I GET ANOTHER TASK I CAN GET THAT ONE DONE TOO.,I WOULD GO.  NETWORKING WITH ONE OF THE LARGEST CLIENTS IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN KNOWING SOMEONE THERE.  THE PURPOSE OF THESE THING IS TO GET TO KNOW OTHER PEOPLE AND TO MAKE CONTACTS THAT YOU CAN REACH OUT TO IN THE FUTURE.,I WOULD ASK MY MANAGER FOR A SITDOWN CONVERSATION.  I WOULD ASK THAT THEY HAVE AN OPEN MIND AND LISTEN TO ME WHILE I EXPLAIN THAT I FELT THAT THEIR FEEDBACK WAS UNTRUE.  I WOULD ASK FOR THEM TO EXPLAIN THEIR CRITERIA FOR THE NEGATIVE FEEDBACK.,I WOULD FIND THIS EXPERIENCE ENJOYABLE.  IT WOULD BE AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN ABOUT HOW THINGS ARE DONE IN OTHER COUNTRIES AND CULTURES AND TO FORM AN INTERNATIONAL NETWORK.
10460002643,"I would first talk to my colleague to find out if there is any way they would consider changing the time frame.  If not, and my plans can’t be changed, I would tell my supervisor that he would need to deny my colleagues request since mine was put in first.  If I put my request in first, it’s not fair for me to have to be forced to change plans.","I would focus on getting my project done early.  That way if additional tasks come up, I’d be able to complete.  This would reduce a lot of stress.",I would still go.  Networking is important and we need to be represented.  It’s also important to respect our clients.,I am very upset.  I would call for a meeting with my manager to further discuss.  I have the right to understand where the negative feedback is coming from.,I would be very happy to take on this project.  It’s fun to learn new things. I think our client would be very impressed if I knew more about their country and cultures.
10459979454,It depends on a couple of things. First are my plans unchangeable if they are I will not concede. Second who requested off first. If it was me I would not give up my trip unless I did not have anything planned.,I would make sure to clear my schedule so that I can work overtime hours as needed to accommodate my bosses behaviour. I would also ask my boss if there is anything on the radar I need to know about. I would do this so I can get a jump start on the work.,I would definitely go to the event with or without my coworker. Not having him or her there would force me to network. In the end it would be best for me.,I would feel pretty crappy about the feedback. I would ask to have a meeting to discuss with my manager how I can improve for next year. I would aim to do better in the coming months.,I would not like this assignment. I am not a person who warms up to people quickly. I do not go out often and I would be bad company. This would be a poor choice for me.
10459662796,It is likely that I would accommodate my coworker in this situation. I would change my vacation plans. I might go on vacation at an earlier time instead of the planned-on time.,I would work extra hard on the project to get it done as soon as possible. I would want to ensure that it got finished efficiently. I don't work well when pressured with too many tasks at once.,"I would probably still go. After all, the client is important and I can likely manage if I absolutely must. While I am shy and would much prefer to have at least one other person I know with me, I can grin and bear it for one evening.","I would definitely feel it is unfair, since I tend to not dismiss constructive criticism without a good reason. However, I probably wouldn't voice my opinion, depending on the situation. If there was a circumstance that my manager might be unaware of, I would attempt to explain myself.","I'd find it exciting because I enjoy learning about other cultures. Norway is one of the countries I already have an interest in, too. I would also like that I wouldn't be required to travel. I'd be eager to learn more about Norwegian culture."
10446109177,"Whoever requested the week off first should get it but, I would take receipts of travel plans to my supervisor to show I can't change my plans. I would suggest possibly hiring a temp for the week if they'd be willing to let us both off at the same time.","I would do as much as the project as I could but leave what I could open-ended in areas where I think my boss will throw me off towards the end. Also, if I think I'm close to completion before the due date I'd ask my boss or someone else to look for what I can add","I would ask if they'd be willing to go with me to the event to introduce me to people and offer to buy them a coffee and breakfast the next day. I could go by myself, but, nepotism plays a large part in networking and I'd rather have someone with me who knows the crowd somewhat. If my colleague continues to not want to go for their own health I would go without them.","I would ask my manager if they could give specific examples of their feedback. I would then explain my perspective and why I disagree, with evidence to support what I'm saying. I would feel extremely disheartened and confused.","I would find this experience enjoyable! Even without the offer of traveling, it's always exciting to learn about a new culture! Plus, it's always good to know clients from all over the world."
10459901542,I would try to speak to my supervisor about finding a fair way to decide which one of us should get the time off. I would be persistent with this approach because I am also not willing to change my vacation plans. I would probably be angry if I am not able to get the time off.,I would complete the project ahead of time if is is really a light workload. I would not tell my boss I am done and I would anticipate a last minute task from him. If he gave me a last minute task I would take care of it without letting him know I am done with the other project.,"I would go to the networking meeting because I don't depend on my colleagues in the workplace to ""guide"" me around. I would network and make sure the client knows my name. I would make this a growing opportunity to ensure I will have a more lead role in future projects with this client.",I would try to talk to my manager about this feedback. If he isn't willing to change it I will file a complaint with the higher ups. If that is not possible I would find a way to make his life more miserable in the future.,I would be interested in this opportunity and would find it enjoyable. Expanding my horizons and possibly making new friends is not something one wants to miss. It doesn't require travel so I would find his easy.
10462888226,"I would consider our seniority/tenure in the situation. If I were the more senior, I would not change my plans and expect the supervisor to handle either both of us being gone or dealing with the other employee. If I were not the more senior, I would see how much time the other employee had to request the time off (assuming I had requested it first).","I would attack the project immediately. There's no reason not to with light work load, and this approach would also allow for the unexpected, last minute work, as well as touch ups to my project.","I would not go. Work-life balance is very critical and even a large client should respect that. Even if my colleague was going, I would weigh my work-life balance very carefully first.","I would address the feedback from the stance of hard evidence, rather than my beliefs. Ask if they can prove my actions/inactions. I would follow up with my plus-2 should I feel this meeting did not go well to make sure the issue was addressed.","I would find it fairly enjoyable as it's an opportunity to learn about something outside my normal duties. I don't like monotonous tasks, and I would use this as a push to be better compensated at my next review."
10440112842,"I would probably change my vacation week to another that would not conflict.  However, I rarely take vacation from work so I probably would not have made any nonrefundable deposits and have greater flexibility to make changes to my schedule.  In fact, I would not have even taken these actions without first guaranteeing that I could have the time off from work.","I would plan out a schedule to work on the project for at least a few hours each day.  Ideally, this would allow the project to be completed with at least 3-4 days to spare.  By adhering to this schedule, a small buffer is already built into the work to allow for any additional tasks the boss may assign throughout the course of these two weeks.  Additionally, I would reach out to my boss and ask if he anticipates any tasks that may need completed during this two week period.","I would probably not go to the networking event.  Although I am not entirely antisocial, I like to compartmentalize the various aspects of my life.  When I am finished with work I like to go home and be done with it.  However, if the colleague went I would probably feel less awkward and might stay at the meeting for a bit to enhance connections in my field.","I would first clarify what the manager was telling me by asking how my performance is being measured.  Then I would request follow-up feedback and ask for suggestions to improve any areas where my performance is lacking.  Even if I did not agree with the criticism, I would still try to implement this new data into my work and make the necessary changes.  After some time, I would ask for additional feedback to see if the improvements I was trying to make had been successful in correcting any problems.",I would find this experience enjoyable.  I generally like to learn about new topics and do so in my free time.  The fact that I would be paid to learn about a different culture and gain further exposure would be very enticing.
10459950104,"Being a compromising person, I would reschedule my break.  I would see no point in trying to fight over something as simple as a vacation.  I am a very understanding person.",I would work hard to have this project finished as soon as possible.  I am not the type to rest on my laurels.  I like to accomplish tasks quickly.,"I would still go to the meeting.  I am not one to shy away from the opportunity to meet people.  Also, I do not need to go places with familiar people to feel comfortable.","I would feel slightly frustrated, but also motivated.  I would want to learn from this, and do my best to improve my performance.  I do not like to be deterred by any letdowns.","I would find this experience to be slightly enjoyable.  I do like to learn about other cultures.  Reading about other cultures is not as fun as immersing oneself in them, but it is better than nothing."
10440111607,"I would figure out whether my vacation plans are set in stone or can be shifted around without significant cost to me. After that, I will discuss with the supervisor on the situation. If I can move it around, I will portray that I am doing the company a favor, I can show up, and that my vacation week was scheduled way in advanced. If it can not be moved around I would say the cost associated and that I scheduled it way in advance.","I would try to complete the workload as quickly as possible. If there's bottlenecks, I would allot specific times to get it done. Due dates are very important to meet unless the level of work is too difficult that your initial proposal was not accurate.","I would try to get the colleague to go and that I would go as well. I need to up the network meeting to make it enjoyable or pretend to be enjoyable. If he still doesn't want to go, I will end up going anyways.

I would rebuttal and focus on the pros versus the cons of the situation. The purpose is to belittle or eliminate the consequences. This is all in a day's work.,"I would find this experience enjoyable but I would portray it as if i'm sacrificing myself for the company (company man). Deep inside, I would find this quite enjoyable.

If not, then I would just try to shift my event.",I would schedule time immediately within the first week to make huge headway and potentially finish within the week. Then I would set a reminder for one day of each week to ask my boss if there are any additional tasks that would need to be completed on a short time frame. Hopefully I could finish the first week. There should be time during the second week to revise and edit the project. If my boss gave me additional tasks to complete then I could use the second week to finish the initial project.,"I would definitely go! I am very outgoing and crowds of people I don't know do not scare me. It sounds like an awesome opportunity and since my attendance is not dependent on my colleague's attendance, I would go. The only way I would not go is if my colleague had prior experience and advised me not to attend.","I would ask my manager for a second meeting where we can discuss the feedback to ensure I understand where it is deriving from. I would ask for proof of the incident in ways such as ""Can you show me exactly where this happened or an example of my work so that I can address the issue and prevent it from re-occuring?"" In this aspect, I am not questioning my manager's ability to provide feedback and manage employees but asking for assistance in resolving the issue. If proof or examples were provided it would also lead to conversations concerning the validity of information where I could raise my concerns if need be.",I would find the experience enjoyable but also stressful. It would be enjoyable to learn the culture and different facets of the country. It would be stressful though to need to learn about the cultural implications in order to perform well at work. This is something I would find enjoyable if assigned the task but I am not totally sure I would outright volunteer for it.
10460208876,"I have actually had to deal with this situation. I have worked for a nonprofit organization for over 4 years. After my first year, I requested time off for vacation. Another coworker with seniority over me requested several days off that overlapped with some of my requested days off. I was asked by my supervisor to change my vacation time request, and I did so without complaint. I was a little miffed, but I understood the situation completely.","Again, this is something I have experienced in my current position. I never have a light workload, though. My boss' projects always take precedence over projects that I do for my coworkers. There have been many occasions in which I had to work overtime because the boss decided at the end of the day that she wanted to have a report done differently, after I had completed it. In summary, I always do what my boss requests of me, even if it's a last-minute thing.","I would attend the meeting by myself, without hesitation. I would be sure to have an adequate supply of business cards on me to distribute when introducing myself to others. I look at such events with positivity; making new contacts is always a good thing, and one never knows when one will need to use one of those contacts in the course of one's job. In my current position, I don't have many opportunities to network, but I always take advantage of the few opportunities to come my way.","I would ask to have a meeting with my manager to discuss the situation. I would like to know why she criticized my work performance. I would be sure to point out how hard I have worked, and how dedicated I am to my job. I would also like to know if anything can be done to rectify the situation.","I would enjoy such an experience. It would allow me to do something different from my usual job; a change of pace every now and then is good. It would prevent me from getting burned out by my usual job duties. I also enjoy doing research, so I would like this assignment."
10459765422,I would change my plans and say that next year I would have priority to choose first. Or I would ask my boss to decide for us. Otherwise  I would see if someone be vould cover for no me to leave as no well.,I would get as much of the project out of the way as I could ahead of time. This would help me avoid stress. It would also help if there were last minute things I was asked to do or if I wanted to add last minute details to my project. Sometimes when its close to the presentation you remember important things to include.,This would be hard for me since I am not very good in social situations with big groups I do not know. I would still make an effort to go since they were important clients. I would likely ask a socially strong friend to accompany me or maybe my husband.,I would do my best to discuss and present with evidence and reason that it is untrue. I would do my best to keep doing the good work I do and prove him wrong. I would go above and beyond what is asked of me and stay late.,I would think it would be interesting and enlightening. It's always good to learn about new places and different no cultures to have a broader or informed perspective of the world around us. I would say I was interested if it didn't include traveling and being away from family.
10459746060,"I would be unwilling. This is a really difficult question because it would depend on who this other colleague was and what my vacation was. Normally when I request for vacation, there is a certain time period where I have to leave to go or perhaps it is a family planned event that I can't go at a different time. So I would probably say that I would also be unwilling to change my vacation plans because it would likely be a family planned event that I would either be there or plain miss it.","I would do this project asap. Just like any other jobs where there is always something that has to be done or thrown at you, I would start this project as soon as I can so that I would get it out of the way. I would either set aside a day considering my world load was light so there would be no reason as to why I would not finish this way before the due date. This would allow me to not have to worry about it last minute and be able to do what my boss tells me to do in a later period.",I would still go to this meeting. This is because I view this to be important in the long term with them being one of my largest clients. I would be able to get on a closer term with these clients and have more say or leeway in the future when dealing with them. My colleague not being there with me would make it a little uncomfortable but the goal is to connect with these clients anyway so it is just a slight discomfort to not have someone I already know being present.,"I would dispute it. Because of such real consequences there is no reason for me to take such an insult and ignore it. Especially since I disagree with it means that I did not view what I had done to have caused negative feedback. I would ask them why they think this and carefully discuss the reasons that led to their decision. If I have proof of me not doing what caused the negativity, I would bring that out also.","I would possibly find this experience enjoyable because it would be something out of the norm for the company. Usually doing the same thing in a company is pretty boring unless you truly enjoy your job. This project allows me to learn about another country and culture, so this would be pretty fun. Getting paid to do something slightly different is refreshing every now and again."
10462987758,"I would change my vacation. I don't usually take vacation unless I'm being forced to so mine seems as if it would be more flexible. Usually I simply sleep the days away anyway and my coworker, who refuses to switch, probably has plans. I'll take the switch myself and let them keep said plans.",I would continue as I have or maybe speed up a bit since I know the load is light. It's better to work harder now and have free time if needed than play now and be swamped later. Especially since my dear boss likes to spring work on me last minute. I would take time and work harder now to prepare for the most likely outcome of having work later.,"I would attempt to convince my coworker. I am not above bribery as well. If not, I'll just go alone and make connections myself. Networking is harder without someone to ease you in but not impossible as long as you have a great personality and can charm people.",I would surely be upset and request a formal meeting. I want to give my manager the chance to present any evidence he has to support his feedback and explain why he believes what he believes while giving myself the chance to challenge this. Especially since a bonus is at stake. I want to make sure this is valid and if not then removed from my record.,I would most likely find it boring. I am not very interested in Norway or it's culture so I can't see myself excited or the opportunity. I would definitely not volunteer.
10459951012,"I would change my vacation since this would make me look good in my the eyes of my boss. Also since I compromised my boss will likely be more lenient next time I need to take a vacation or take time off work. My coworker might have a better relationship with me at work since I was willing to compromise. Overall I think the working relationship between me, my boss, and my coworker will be a lot better if I decide to take the vacation another week.",I would go to my boss ahead of time and ask him if there is anything extra he wants me to do for the project. By asking him he might give me the tasks ahead of time instead of last-minute giving me more time to do the task. If he says he has nothing I would work hard to get the project done as soon as possible since this would allow me to do tasks as they come up. By following this strategy I won't be strapped for time and won't be under a lot of stress right before the project is due. Making sure I get the project done would be advantageous to not only me but the company overall so I will work my hardest to get it done.,"I would still go to the meeting since the idea of a networking meeting is to meet new people, hence the networking. If I depend on my partner to be there it might hinder my ability to network since I would probably stay near him most of the time. Also by going to this meeting, the client might do more business with my company, so the meeting might be beneficial to me and the company that I am with.","I would follow the feedback and try to change my work to follow the feedback since it has real-world consequences. While I personally feel the feedback might not be true since there is a possibility of me losing my annual bonus I could lose money by not following the feedback. If I have the feedback in mind while I doing my work the overall quality of my work might also increase which means maybe in the future I could get a promotion or larger bonuses. Also, the ability to adapt is good for any future job I have so this could be a good learning experience for me.","I would find the experience boring since I am not really deeply interested in our countries culture. Working on this project probably means I would have to help him learn something about our culture. I feel I wouldn't do well on this job since I am not an expert on the culture of our country, also the culture varies by a lot depending on where you are. The only good thing about this experience I can think of is that I might be able to learn about Norway."
10462982022,I would change my vacation if possible.  However if that is not feasible then the coworker who put in the request first should be the one to get the time for vacation.  I would express this thought to our supervisor.,"I would begin working on the project when it is first assigned.  You never know what other work or what life is going to throw your way, so procrastination is everyone's worst enemy.  I would do everything possible to ensure that my project is completed in plenty of time and in perfect order before presenting.","I would go to the networking meeting with our largest client. You must cultivate these relationships in order to maintain good business.  Also, the point of a networking meeting with a client is not to chat with a co-worker but to work the room and build relationships with other potential clients.","I would write a rebuttal to the negative feedback with the manager.  If possible, I would schedule a meeting with the manager to clarify their interpretation, they must not have all of the information necessary to give feedback of this nature on my work.",I would find the potential of learning about the culture and country of Norway.  I would also hope for the potential of travel for the purpose of this project.  I would happily accept involvement on the project.
10459720997,"I would first talk to my colleague and find out if there is a reason that they won't change because I already have reservations.  If there is a sincere need, and they aren't such being a jerk, I will call and see if I can change my reservations.  If they aren't decent, I will go back to the supervisor and explain that I have reservations, and the colleague doesn't.  I will let the supervisor intervene and find the best way to go.","I would go ahead and work as hard as I could to finish my project ahead of schedule.  That way, if the boss gives last minute tasks it won't put me behind.  I would then keep everyone happy.",I would go ahead and go even though I wouldn't know anyone else because of it being one of my largest clients.  It could be a good thing that my colleague isn't going because who knows who I will meet and help to further my career.,"I would definitely not be happy, but I would take some time and calm down.  I would gather evidence to show all the work that I have accomplished, and ask for a meeting.  I would allow my manager to say what they want, then I would show my evidence and show that he was wrong.","I would personally find it boring.  I am not big on learning about other cultures because I live in the United States, and don't plan on leaving.  I would do it if my boss needed me to, but it wouldn't be something that I would volunteer to do."
10459850691,I would consider my plans and see if there was a way I could make a change. I would change my plans if it were feasible. I would let my coworker know that I would be making the sacrifice. I hope that my flexibility would prove good for my career.,"I would plan ahead. I would try to accomplish all the tasks for the project as son as possible, leaving time to spare in case I have extra tasks added. I would keep my supervisor up to date on my progress.",I would go to the meeting with or without my coworker. I wouldn't want to miss the opportunity to network. I would hope that putting myself out there would be good for my career.,I would feel upset at this situation. I would schedule time to sit down one on one with my supervisor to express my concern and try to clarify what they are thinking. I would look for ways to improve to offset any consequence.,I would definitely find this experience enjoyable. I love history and culture. I am always ready to learn. I would hope that travel would be involved.
10462983718,"I would also not change my vacation plans. I booked my vacation plans first, so he has to change his plans. First come first serve. It's important to stand your ground.","I would keep ahead of schedule. Knowing my boss, he always dumps work on me last second. I will stay one step ahead of him this time.","I would coerce him to go. This is a huge business opportunity, and it would be folly not to network. This is our key to rising up the ranks.","I would fight it if it means I don't get a bonus. I'll stage a situation to make him realize he's completely wrong. Afterwards, he'll give me praise. Easy.",I would find it boring. I don't find anything useful from learning about places I'll never get to go to. It would be a different story if I was going to go there.
10459685853,"I would act depending on my circumstances. For example, if I ready paid for something that cannot be reimbursed in the case of canceling, I would request that I must be on vacation that week. On the other hand, if a colleague has a family needs to take vacation just this time, I may reconsider",I would make all efforts to finish this project ASAP. It is better to have a few days to perfect the project than to be in a situation of extreme time shortage. It is a good and proven strategy,"I would go in any case. Actually, I am really surprised to see such a reaction from my colleague. This is unprofessional at least.","I would feel really bad about this situation. If I believe that this feedback is unfair, I would start looking for a new job. No visible emotions, though...",I would be glad to take such an assignment. The Nordic countries are special in many respects. I would really enjoyed to learn some things about Norway
10459886825,I would try and talk to my colleague and see if he would change his week. If he stills says no I will change mine so there wont be any problems.So everyone will be happy.,"I would since I know that my boss likes to throw last min task at me finish my project early. Then dont say its done so when he throws last min task at me ,I will be free and clear. I will just keep doing my daily workload.",I would go to the networking meeting because one of your largest clients asked you to go.It doesn't matter if you know know anyone start talking you will get to know people.And ask your colleague to join you to learn a few things.,I would ask for a meeting with the manager about the feed back.And ask him what you can do to fix it because you dont want the consequences of losing my bonus. Then explain that your a hard worker and that you do not thing the feedback was right and you would like a redo.,I would find it enjoyable to learn something new about Norway. Then learn about there country and there culture would be awesome. It would be even better if I went to Norway to see the people and see the sites.
10459868280,"I would offer to change my vacation plans if possible.  I understand needing to balance how many employees are out of the office at one time and would be accommodating to the other employee if I could reschedule my plans.  However, I could not move my vacation either, I think the deciding factor should be who asked off first and management should step in to reinforce that.","I would go ahead and work on the project while I have time.  I don't like to wait until the last minute.  I prefer to go ahead and get things done, especially while I have time, and check them off my list.",I would go.  This is a big opportunity for you and your company.  You can't ignore one of your largest clients and this could end up giving you an edge over your colleague.,"I would ask my manager about the feedback, who it came from (if not anonymous/confidential) and for specifics.  Sometimes feedback is more personal than it should be and people's feelings can overshadow their judgement and how they view situations.  If I knew specifics, I may be able to voice my side of the story.",I would find this experience enjoyable.  I always love learning about other places and cultures.  Bonus if I actually would get to go there.
10459721582,If I had a plan tripped with family members that had taken the time off work I wouldnt budge either.  Just because it was something planned out ahead of time and they wouldnt be able to change it.  I would also talk to them and explain it to both of them the situation.  I would hope they would be understanding.  But the other person seems to be a pain.,I would handle this project head on.  I would have to spend longer hours working on it.  I would also remind my boss before that I have one project that is due in a few weeks.  I dont see why i wouldnt be able to get both done.,I would ask them very nice to please go with me.  And if that didnt work I would tell them if they would go I would take them out to dinner coffee or something to make up for them going.  If they really couldnt go then I would be going by myself.,I would think it over the rest of the day.  I would talk to my spouse about it and see what he thought.  Then I would go and have a talk with the manager about the feedback.  See if there is something I can do to change it or just make things right.,I would really find this enjoyable.  To be able to learn about norway would be something great.  Not only that but it would look really good if I decided to work somewhere else or forward my job.  I think it would be a lot of fun.
10462882516,I will take up with the Supervisor for a commonly accepted procedure for handling vacation conflict resolution. A fair method in authorizing vacation should be acceptable and be implemented by my supervisor. I will politely request for such a procedure be implemented.,I would proactively finish or at least do lot of prep. work to ensure that the timelines are complied in the event that some last minute request come up.,"My answer would depend how much my absence will impact my work in future. If my absence does not matter much in terms of my career and job responsibilities, i would convey my absence.",I would feel In have been unfairly treated and I will definitively inform my Manager that I have been treated by him unfairly and ask him to reverse his decision based upon fact which I will present to him/her. In case he refuses to handle my feedback professionally I will lodge my grievance with HR of this unfair treatment.,"Yes, I would love to venture this opportunity. After all life is full of learning and experience."
10459710452,"I would give in and change my vacation time. It wouldn't be ideal, but in the eyes of the boss it will look better me taking initiative. I would remind my colleague I did this for them and make sure they owe me one.",I would get what I need to get done quick. This is because I will have more time to do last second tasks my boss may give me. I would be in contact with my boss everyday to see if anything changes.,I would talk my colleague into going with me. I would go over the pros and tell them I would buy them a beer after. This would be a good networking time and they need to know that too.,I would talk to my boss one on one and go over what happened and their view on it. I would feel bad about the situation and make sure he knows that I am passionate about what I do. I would sit down and lay it all there because what else would I have to lose.,I would love to take part in this project. I love learning about other cultures and would do my research. I would hope that one day i could go to norway on the company's dime.
10459713826,I would ask for overpay. I would ask to reschedule my vacation. I would make the best of the situation. I would work and make my money.,I would ask for an extension. I would ask a coworker to help me. I would bring this up in a workplace meeting. I would ask for another date to make up my work.,I would ask to take coworker or friend. I would ask if someone else could go in my place. I would ask the person  inviting me to introduce me to others there. I would ask if more coworkers could  join us.,I would ask for the manager to reverse her choices. I would ask another manager for an appeal. I would work on doing better work. I would take up extra work responsibilities.,I would find this enjoyable. This would open my  mind to cultural differences. I would enjoy learning another language. I would find this somewhat of a challenge because it is a new experience.
10440110085,"I would go ahead and change the dates of my requested time off. It seems like my colleague has plans that they cannot change, so it is not a big deal for me to take some different days off instead. I would feel bad leaving work understaffed if we both took the time off at the same time.","I would get started on the project right away. I know it is possible that my boss could give me additional tasks, and I don't want to feel stressed out at the last minute. I don't have much else going on at work right now anyway, so I might as well get started on the new project.","I would go to the networking meeting without my colleague because it sounds important to maintaining business relationships. I might attempt to only stay a short while, since I won't know anyone there, but I would still want to show my face. I would probably go and then pretend to get called away after a bit of time.","I would try not to react negatively or defensively. I would try to remain positive and go to my manager and request their ideas on how to improve my performance. Even if I don't agree with what they said, I feel it is in my interest to get that person on my side.","I would definitely let my company know I am available to help out with the project because I am willing to, but I don't know if I would find the experience enjoyable or not. I guess it would be interesting to learn about a different culture for work. I mainly just like to be available to help at work, so if that's what they need me to do, I would do it."
10459740725,"I would probably let them have it depending what their plans were. It would depend on seniority. If I really wanted and thought my time was more important to be off, I would ask my supervisor to please consider that.",I would get as much done every day as possible. I would try to keep up with other pop up tasks as they arose. I would aim to make sure I met the two week deadline.,I would probably go anyway since it would be important for my career. The colleague would lose out on networking. This may work to my advantage in long run.,I would feel awful. I would request a meeting with my supervisor. I would as for an improvement plan to allow me time to correct the perceived shortcoming.,I would find this extremely enjoyable! I love learning new things about different countries and cultures. This would be a great opportunity.
10450564161,"I would first consider whether my requested vacation has already been accepted by our employer and if I have plans set for it. If that is the case and there are others involved in my vacation that have already made plans then I would tell my colleague that there is no way I can change those plans. However, if we are both just in the requesting phase and don't have any definite plans set, then I would likely be flexible and take vacation at a different time so my colleague can have that week if it is important to them.",I would complete it as soon as possible so if my boss does  give me another task then I'll feel comfortable with my project. I would be sure to communicate to my boss that I have a project due and would like at least a couple days leading up to the due date free to make sure I have it completed and checked. I would also be sure to keep my boss informed of my progress on the project so that if they do have tasks that come up I can plan for them and complete them accordingly. Communication would be key in this situation. I would make the assumption that the project is more important than tasks my boss may give me in the meantime and that they would understand this as well.,It isn't important to me whether I know someone at the networking event or not. I think I would actually make more connections and talk to more people if I don't know anyone there so it could actually be a benefit. I would also be quite confident that if I have been working with my company for a while and dealing with the clients we are networking with that I would make connections through others at the event and have a good time. I can't really think of a scenario where I would not go unless I had previous plans.,"I would feel very frustrated and possibly slighted. I would tell my manager my feelings on the feedback and let them know why it is so important to me and why I disagree. If they do not see my point of view or continue to disagree, I would have to speak to the person above my manager at the company to get their input, but not without informing my manager of that plan. If this was a reoccuring situation with that employer then the company that I am working at may not be a good fit and I would likely consider other options.","This project would be awesome. I would likely be quite willing to travel for it as well so that I can gain a better understanding of the country and culture. I think it would be very enjoyable and I would also be thinking of the fact that volunteering may help advance my career with the company. If however, I didn't find the project exciting, I would likely not volunteer."
10441705348,I would offer up to hold back on my vacation over my colleague. Reason being is if they have children or a family that time is far more vital. I would hope to take that time and plan my vacation more while waiting for them to come back to work.,I would make sure to keep a clear mind and brace for the sudden last minute workload. I would then organize my materials needed to tackle the projects. I would also try to push the deadline and have everything done in under a weeks' time.,I would try to see what makes them timid to attend the meeting and convince them to go. I would use sayings such as two heads are better than one. I would try my best to talk them into attending the meeting.,I would try to have an open conversation with my manager. I would make an intention to find out what my weaknesses were that lead to the feedback. And hope to come to a conclusion.,"I would find this experience enjoyable because of the aspect of possibly traveling. I would see this as a new way to get out of my comfort zone, and get an education at the same time. I would see this as building my career then something boring."
10460343014,I would probably be able to change my plans. I do not tend to make concrete plans anyway. I don't like to make hard reservations or plans and prefer to be flexible.,I would complete the main bulk of the project ahead of time to give myself room to complete any last minute changes my boss wanted to make.,"I would go. I am pretty good in social situations, and this sounds like a good chance to make some solid contacts that would improve my chances at work.","I would write my rebuttal in the space provided, and would follow up with HR to see what my options are. I would also appeal to the next higher supervisor to see if the situation can be fixed.","I would find the experience very enjoyable. I have lived all over the world, and really enjoy having new cultural experiences outside of my own."
10459781383,"I would discuss the situation further with my colleague. I would see why they are insistent on keeping their vacation for that specific week. If they have a legitimate reason, such as a cruise, wedding or such, that can not be changed, and mine can, I would be willing to change my week off. If they didnt have a set reason, then I would suggest a fair way for us to chose the person who keeps the week off. Im all about fairness.","I would get as much of the project done as soon as I can. I would want to have time to make sure I finish it, and well. That way, if something is thrown at me last minute, I wouldn't have to stress as much about getting that and the project done. Less stress the better.","I would go to the meeting still. While being told last minute is annoying, it looks good to the client, and your superiors, if you show up. I am normally shy when I don't know anyone around, but if its for a work purpose, Id be willing to socialize a bit more. This would show initiative.","I would ask my manager to give me more information on this situation. I would want to discuss exactly how this feedback came about, and see how I can improve, if needed. If it truly was deserved, I would do whatever I needed to to make it better. If it was undeserved, then I would try to take it to the next level up in the company for resolution.","I would love to take part in this experience. I have always been fascinated by other countries and cultures. It would also look good to my superiors at work, if I was willing to take on such a project. Additionally, any new knowledge gained is always a good thing."
10459703248,"I would probably give in and change my plans.  I don't really like conflict and I would rather change plans than rock the boat.  If it happened repeatedly, I might say something.",I would try to finish the project as soon as possible.  I would like to make sure that I have plenty of time and attention if I receive more work to do.  I would not let on to my boss that I was trying to finish early so that they would not purposely give me a lot more work to do.,I probably would not go to the meeting unless it was a requirement.  I don't really like going to social events alone.  I may go if I feel that it would benefit me personally not just the company.,"I would spend some time reflecting on the feedback to see if there is any validity to it.  If I still felt that it was unfair, I would discuss my concerns with my manager.  If the manager refused to see things from my perspective, I may take it up with someone over the manager.",I would love to work on a project in Norway.  I would think that it would definitely be an enjoyable experience and I would find learning about the country and culture interesting.  I would definitely volunteer for the project.
10459955547,"I would change my vacation time because I am a nice guy. In addition, I would likely not make a big stink about it. Perhaps my colleague has plans that they cannot change.","I would do it as quickly as possible. In addition, I would work quickly and probably put in some overtime to make sure things were completed quickly. Finally, I think I would be able to handle the additional tasks regardless.",I would go to the networking. I'm not a naturally nervous person. I do well in large crowds to be honest.,"I think it would be absurd to receive negative feedback. In addition, if I didn't deserve the negative feedback. I would challenge it.",I think i would be neutral towards this experience. I don't really think about where people are from when working. It usually doesn't matter.
10456136899,I think this would depend on the vacation plans I had. If I had planned a vacation that involved airfare or something similar I would have a talk with my colleague first to see if he could change his plans. If he couldn't I would let my supervisor know that my vacation time had already been approved and that I couldn't change my plans given that I had already purchased the tickets and booked the hotel. If my vacation was more of a week off work I would likely switch my dates.,"I would likely begin work on the project while my workload was light, although I almost certainly would not finish the project two weeks early. I would do this because I would not want to be working nights and weekends if my boss gave me a last second task that interfered with my project due date. I do procrastinate, but I still ensure I can deliver my work products on time.","I think this depends on how involved with the client I am. If I am only partly involved with the client I would see if I could talk my work colleague into going, especially if there was free dinner and drinks. If it was one of my biggest clients personally, I would still try to talk to the colleague into going, but if they did not go I would still go to put on a good show for the company.","This situation would upset me. I would likely try to find other feedback from my manager's peers that provide evidence that I do not or have not done what the manager is inferring I did. Depending on my role and options, this may also cause me to begin to look elsewhere for new roles, either outside the company or in other departments within the company. I am fine with negative feedback as I believe it helps us grow, but if I feel the feedback is inaccurate I would want the record set straight.","I would find the experience extremely enjoyable. I love traveling, especially on the company dime and I like working with international clients and on international projects. I feel it really helps you grow as an individual. Learning about how other places do business."
10462907172,"I would stay back and  cover up for the two of us, provided i don't have any plans that can be cancelled, because if so will both have to leave our boss to decide or we both reach a compromise",I would plan towards devoting extra time at home to see the project come to completion. An extra 1hr before sleep everyday would do some magic.,"I would go, that would give me the opportunity to make new  friends, and i also don't see my partners absence as a set back of any sort","i would feel really bad and depressed. but then that doesn't solve any thing. So, i'll try and understand his reason for the negative feedback and work towards improving","I would be really glad to accept the offer, as learning about other cultures and languages fascinates me.It would also give the opportunity of  meeting new friends and network more"
10459768768,"I would offer to change my vacation plans to help out my coworker. I assume that they have a good reason for not changing their plans (maybe unrefundable plane tickets) so I can be flexible. Plus, I don't have kids so it's easier for me to change my plans anyhow.","I would carve out blocks of time to work on this bigger project each day. For example, I would schedule 9 am to 1 pm to work on the project each day and I would allocate 1 pm to 5 pm to ""potential last minute tasks"". If I didn't have anything assigned to me from 1-5 then I'd keep working on my project. This way I'm able to commit full attention to the more important task but still allowing myself some wiggle room for the unexpected.","I would absolutely still go to the networking meeting. This is an important client that likely brings a lot of money to my company. Without the presence of my colleague, we'd both be essentially letting the client know that we don't care about their business. I think that is unprofessional, so I would make an effort to go. I'd just leave enough time for me to unwind after the meeting so that I can have a good work-life balance.","I would feel upset by this situation, but would feel more determined to straighten things out than anything. I would schedule a time to talk with my boss to calmly understand our differing perspectives. I would tell him/her what I'm hearing them say and how my perspective of the situation differs from theirs. Although my bonus is on the line, I care much more about my reputation.","I would find this somewhat boring. I would love to travel to Norway but just reading about the country does not sound appealing to me. If this would benefit my company, though, and no one else wanted to do it, I'd pitch in."
10446122651,I would be okay changing my vacation. It’s not worth causing a problem over something minor. It would be okay because if I had just put in the request I won’t have to cancel reservations or lose any deposits. I would request that if I change my plans I could have my next vacation request met first.,I would get everything done early and as soon as possible. Then if I have a last minute task I would have time and minimize my stress.,I would ask that they consider attending even for a short time. I would offer to help them in someway in the future.,I would calmly speak with my manager about why they feel this way. Then ask how they feel I can improve. I would tell them I will make an effort to rectify the situation but also let them know I don’t agree with their assessment. I would give them some reasons to backup my point of view.,It could be interesting to learn about another country and culture. I would even ask to travel.
10440097760,"I would once again try to work something out with this person. I could explain that I need to be with my family this week and see if they're willing to let me have the vacation first. If not I would have no choice but to work, maybe if I offered something in return work related they'd be willing to let me take my vacation first. Although, I would feel bad because I am sure they have a family as well so i'd probably end up just working and waiting for my week.",I would try to get my workload done as quickly as possible. Obviously I would make sure it was done right but if I can get it done before the due date I am certain if my boss added extra tasks I could focus better on it. If I couldn't get the work done before the due date I would maybe work overtime if I needed too.,I would try to convince my colleague to go. I would state all the reasons going is a good thing. This meeting could be very beneficial to them in the future.  Of course I couldn't force the to go if they didn't want to but maybe I could go on their behalf if anything.,"I would feel very disappointed in myself. I would like to think I could go to my manager and maybe compromise on certain things, because I would regret losing my bonus. I am not sure it would have much sway but if you don't try the answer is always no. I could say I would definitely try harder at work in the future.","I would find this experience enjoyable. I would love to learn the language, Norway is somewhere I've always been interested in. Growing up I was into alot of music from there, I would love to know more about this place, i've been so interested in it and this opportunity seems very very appealing to me."
10440172181,"I would be upset, but I would probably just reschedule my vacation. I like to help out when I can. Being my colleague is unwilling to change their vacation plans, they might think better of me if I reschedule. I would also like to think the business would think better of me for letting the other person take their vacation and I'd reschedule.","I would try to get the project done several days before it was due. I like to get things done before they're due. It helps me feel better, and it also makes sure everything will be done. If my boss gave me more tasks, then I would have time to work on them.","I would try to convince my colleague to go. If they wouldn't go, I wouldn't feel comfortable on my own. I'm not the best when meeting new people. I get very nervous and have a hard time speaking. So, unless my colleague went, I don't think I would go.","I would be very upset. If that wasn't my only manager, I would want to talk to another manager and see if they felt the same way. If that was the only manager I would try and explain how I think they are not true, as nice and calmly as I could. I would hope I would be able to resolve the situation or if nothing else at least understand why my manager came to the conclusion that they did.","I would volunteer I think. I like to learn new things about different cultures from time to time. It would be interesting to find out how things are different in Norway compared to here. Although it said travel wouldn't be necessary, it might be nice to travel there some time."
10440098238,find out why they did not want to change. If they had a really good reason I would consider changing my plans. I would talk with the supervisor first then make plans,I would probably get the project done as soon as I could. I would leave time to handle any additional duties as assigned. I would also ask others for help if I needed it.,I would probably go by myself. I would think it beneficial to network with these people. I would try to talk my colleague into going but would go on my own if I had to.,I would be very frustrated by this situation. I would definitely talk to a supervisor about it. I would not simply accept it I would fight for myself,Very enjoyable. I like learning about other countries. I would definitely be interested in doing this.
10459693938,"I would ask my co-worker what his/her plans are.  Ultimately to me it would depend on whom put in the vacation request first.  As well it depends on what the plans are, to see if travel is refundable or can be changed.","I would start the new project right away.  If my work load is currently light, I can easily divert some time to start working on the new project.  That way if my boss does add in some last minute work, I will already be ahead of the game.",I would probably not want to go.  I am not the most social person so it would be very anxious for me.  KNowing that it is a large client and if it is important for the business that would ultimately lead me to go alone.,"I would not be very happy if this happened to me.  The first thing I would do is request a meeting with my boss to understand acutely what the issue is.  If the negative review is wrong, I would at least like the chance to state my case rather than just accepting it without all the facts presented.","I would of course like to travel, but I would willingly accept the task if it just involved learning about the country and culture.  I am a large fan of learning new langugages, culture and new people.  It would be fun and very important to know some possible cultural differences between our country and our new client."
10459889106,I would just reschedule my schedule plans.  I do not care for confrontation and it's really not that big of a deal.  I'm still going to get a vacation.  Sounds easy enough if they agree with it.,I would do the best job I could for my boss on the project.  I would ask for help if needed from my boss. I would give my boss exactly what they are looking for.  So the job would get completed to the best of my ability.,I would try to convince colleague to attend the meeting.  But if I am unsuccessful I would do the best of my ability to do the best that I can.  I would go to the meeting anyway and represent the company.  I would also talk to my boss about my colleague not attending and see what that's about.,I would be pretty upset about situation.  I would end  talking to my boss about the situation and try to convince them that I had nothing to do with whatever they felt was negative.  I would tell them everything I've done positively for the company.  I would show them what I mean to the company and ask to please reconsider my bonus.,I would find the experience enjoyable because I would learn new things.  It would really depend on what the new things are that I would learn.  I would also learn about Norway and the culture which is totally awesome.  I would like to be part of this project.
10459751544,"I would reschedule my vacation.  I know when the next time this scenario rolls around, I'll expect him to change his next time.  Better to have peace at work.",I would knock it out right away. That way I would have plenty of time to work on anything my boss gives me at last minute. Better to be safe than sorry.,I would still go anyway. If it's with one of our largest clients then I would like to attend to make some business connections. That way I would have more opportunity to learn more contacts.,I would ask my boss to reconsider the evaluation. Maybe some sort of compromise can be made so things work out for the best.,I would volunteer. I think it would be exciting to learn more about different cultures. Plus it also make sure more well-rounded employee.
10440163565,I would try and sit down with my colleague over lunch and see if we could have a civil conversation about the issue. I'd want to see if there might be any room for compromise between us. I'd promise to do a favor for them during a time in which a similar situation might arise.,"I would spend a bit of time each day working on the project, making sure it's heading down the right path towards completion. I'd be sure that things stay organized and that all the elements are in the right place. Doing this should keep things nice and orderly and help to protect against any additional work that might come up later.",I would try and pitch the idea to them about how promising a event could be for both of us if we attended. I'd tell them that if they come along with me that I would in turn accompany them to a event of their choosing in the future. I think would carry out these actions in hopes that it might persuade them to come along and make things a bit more comfortable for me and them.,I would try and calm myself and keep a level head before deciding on my next course of action. I'd try and get my manager to maybe share a little more detail on why they came to the conclusion they did. I'd also try to see if there is anything in particular I can do to try and rectify the situation and steer it towards a more suitable outcome for myself.,I would find it very appealing and potentially enlightening. The prospect of getting to know about another culture and it's people would be very exciting. I'd look forward to the chance of broadening my horizons when it comes to meeting different people.
10440150746,I would let them take their vacation that week unless I had very important set plans. There is no reason not to. I would be aware that taking second choice for vacation would show my willingness to do what company needs also.,"I would handle both the light load and also work on the project due in two weeks. That is I would work simultaneously on both making sure all bases covered,not wait till last minute to work on project..or let daily tasks possibly pile up..",I would go as it is part of networking and essential to job in my eyes. It is also an opportunity to get to know client better. I would try to coax fellow employee into going also.,I would talk to my manager and at least be heard before just accepting negative feedback. That is unless it was true. Then I would learn from it and hope it was presented in a way to not minimize my positive contributions to company. I am a person who likes to be heard and discuss how and what i can do to improve.,I would find it extremely interesting and a stimulating project. I am interested in other cultures and I am Scandinavian so a chance to learn more.
10459881487,"I would take my vacation a different week. While I'm not a pushover, it has always been easy for me to reschedule vacations. My leisure travel plans are usually flexible. By doing this, I feel that I would be a team player.","I would complete the project as soon as possible. Having a light work load is nice, but it's good to get things done and over with. This would ensure that there are no issues in case any last minute tasks arise.","I would go to the networking meeting. Long day or not, this is the only choice for me. I think I would be at an advantage by going it alone. I would meet new contacts.","I would attempt to discuss the issue and resolve it with my manager. Surely there is a reason I am being singled out. If there is no resolution, I would escalate the issue to his/her supervisors. I take my bonus seriously, and will not allow office politics to take it away.","I would definitely volunteer for the project. I feel that it will make me more valuable and open up new opportunities. Also, I would get to learn more about another country. This is a win win situation."
10462906622,I would ask what company policy is in this situation. It would seem like seniority must have something to do with who would be allowed to take this week off. There has to be some structure in place for making decisions of this kind.,"I would try to finish it as soon as possible no matter what my workload was at the moment or how long I thought it might take me to complete it. Work often involves last minute issues that have to be completed. In this case, it would pay to be proactive.",I would still go. I don't need someone to hold my hand at something like a networking meeting. I'm sure it would be fine for me to go alone and introduce myself. It might even show that I'm more interested than my colleague.,I would make a written request to speak with my manager and my manager's supervisor. I would want them both to know exactly why I disagreed with the feedback and make sure there wasn't some type of miscommunication. I would also want to know how to avoid this negative feedback in the future.,"I would probably find it enjoyable even if I wasn't able to travel there - although who knows - that might come up in the future. It always helps to make yourself indispensable at work by, maybe, know something others don't."
10440105411,"It all really matters the reasoning behind my vacation. Do i have something planned and already bought for? Or was it just the spur of the moment? If it is already paid for and things, than I would ask to know who requested time off first. Whoever was last should be the one that changes their week.","I would try and work through whatever the project is at a pretty swift pace. If only, because with my boss giving me larger things at the end of projects. I want to be completely ready and hoping that I have enough time to finish it.","I would first off try to convince my colleague to come with me. Even if they don't decide to go, I would still go even if I didn't want to. I would feel like id have to go and I wouldn't want to disappoint whoever invited us.","I would feel frustrated and upset. I would wait a few days before approaching my manager again and trying to bring up the topic. I don't know if they are right or wrong, but I would at least sort of try to get them to change their mind.",Completely enjoyable. I always find learning about places I don't know much about as a good time. It would be extra nice knowing that me learning this stuff might make our deal with this client even stronger.
10460408817,I would take the high road and change my vacation week.  I always believe in being a team player.  I would just move my vacation until the week after.,I would help my co worker on the project until my boss gives me more work.  I belive in helping the team as much as necessary.  I like to keep our inventory and production as current as possible.  This will be good for the entire team.,I would still go to the meeting because it’s always nice meeting new people.  This will give me a chance to learn a lot about our new client.  This could help us out in our work department.,I would set a private meeting with my manager. I would let her know why I disagree with the feedback.  Mynplan would be for us both to come to a compremize to work better.,I would enjoy this experience because it’s food to learn about other countries.  I would want to know about how they handle the traditions and norms.  Thisnwill also give me a chance to meet a lot of new people.
10459725282,I would see if I can change my plans.  This would hopefully make me look better in the eyes of my supervisor.  If I could not change my plans I would ask the supervisor who submitted a request for the vacation time first.,I would try to get the project done early.  This way I would have time to complete anything last minute my boss assigns to me.  I would also plan just as though he had already assigned me these last minute projects.,I would go to the networking meeting regardless.  I think this would be an important opportunity.  I also think this would make me look good to the clients.,I would be angry.  I would ask my boss to mentor me to improve on these performance lacking areas. I would also ask my boss if he would re-evaluate me based on the mentoring plan.,I would find this enjoyable.  I always like to learn about new cultures.  I also think this could help me if additional projects arise of this nature.
10446148338,"I would talk to my colleague and see what their plans are. I would probably end up changing my vacation plans to another week to make things work. I would feel cheated that I had to wait for the next week to take vacation, but I would get over it.",I would try to get started on the project right away. I would complete as much of it as I could early. Then I would review it just ahead of the deadline and make any last minute changes.,"I would try to find out if any one else from the company is going. I would then decide what to do, but I probably would not go if my colleague isn't going and someone else will be there to represent the company. I would feel uncomfortable about going on my own without knowing anyone else.","I would ask to speak with them in more detail privately. I would explain why I made the decision to do what I did, and try to explain myself. Then I would ask them to give me an example of a similar situation and how they would like me to respond if that scenario happened.",I would find this experience boring. I'm not really interested in learning about other cultures. I would also feel it is a waste of time since I wouldn't be traveling to that country anyway.
10460255391,"I would figure out what he needs to take a vacation for and depending what it is and what i need my vacation for, i would ether take another week off or not be willing to change.",I would take my project one day at a time and assured it is finished. If my boss tosses any extra work my way i would take more time to finish it. I would keep working on it longer if i needed to get it done intime.,I would ask my colleague why he doesn't want to go. Depending on how he answers i wouldn't keep bringing it up and trying to get him to go. If it came down to it i would just go solo and try to do it myself,I would complain to my manager and tell him to fix it. Would gather up all the evidence to point out that it isn't true. If he doesn't budge i would take it higher up and complain to his boss about it. Would keep going higher up the ladder till someone fixes the problem of a lying.,"I would not find this experience enjoyable. Learning stuff about another country and culture doesn't interests me in anyway, and would just come off has extra chores and tedious work to me. Would turn the offer down if i was offered, but would still do it if i had to."
10440121464,"I think I would have to try to convince my coworker to change their vacation plans first.  If that didn't work, I would have to look at my own plans.  As a last ditch effort, I might suggest we try to randomly decide who gets that week off.",I would get started on the project right away so that I would be sure to complete it.   There could be unforeseen circumstances.  I could run into trouble.,"I would go anyway.  I would feel really bad if there might be a missed opportunity for me to network with some influential people.  I might not be really interested in going, but it would be best in the long run for me to go.",I would feel terrible. I would probably voice my disagreement and try to be persuasive that I deserve to earn my bonus. I wouldn't be able to do nothing and risk losing my bonus.,I would definitely volunteer for this job.  I have always wanted to go to Norway and I think I would enjoy it.  I am good at talking with people from other cultures.
10459775214,"I would appeal to my coworker again. And if that did not work, I would ask my employer to reconsider and see if there was a way that we could cover the business. If we could not come to an agreement then I would have to call in those days. Family time is just as important  as work time.",I would work toward completing  it as quickly as possible. I would free up my time so that I could perform the upcoming task. That way I am not left feeling rushed by my employer.,"I would convince my friend to go, because I have a need to feel safe. I do not like having to meet people I do not know. I also still want to keep up with my colleagues.",I would feel upset by the situation. However I have a tendency to avoid conflict. Thus I would probably do nothing out of fear of sparking a conflict.,"I would find this resaerch enjoyable. However, I would not enjoy the travel. I am scared of new situations."
10459784536,I would go to my supervisor and explain to them that I asked for the week off first. I would make my supervisor aware that I booked the vacation several months in advance like I typically do (which he is aware of).  I would then confront my coworker and explain to them the situation and advise them to ask for their time off sooner and that my trip has been planned.,I would complete the project in advance when my work load is light. I am not a procrastinator so I do not like leaving things until the last minute anyways.  I know that my boss likes giving me projects at the last second so I would feel more comfortable doing this project.,I would encourage my coworker to go for moral support.  I would explain to them that it would look good for two representatives from our company there and quite frankly I do not want to go alone.  If she does not go I would not go either.,I would take the time to let it settle in before I respond the wrong way to my boss without thinking it through. That night I would brainstorm a list of why this information is not true.  I would then set up a appointment to go over the situation and my defense with my boss at a later date.,I would not find this project/experience enjoyable. There is too much to learn and I would not know specifically how to narrow it down. I would rather be involved in this project if it meant traveling to learn about culture and experience it.
10462857264,"I would suggest to my boss that whoever put in their vacation request first should be granted the time off. If it was my colleague, then I would gladly reschedule my vacation time. If, however, I put in the vacation request first, then I would suggest my boss have a conversation with my colleague about his stubbornness on this issue.","I would attempt to get the vast majority of the project completed in the first two weeks of the allotted time. This would allow for me to not stress about the fact that I may get additional work in the last week of working on the project. In my experience murphy's law tends to rear it's head on these project, so it's best to try and get the work done as quickly as possible.","I would try and persuade my colleague into going. Though I wouldn't try and manipulate my colleague into going, I wouldn't be honest as to the reason why my colleague should go. I don't want to look like a wimp and say directly to my colleague that the reason he or she should go is because I don't know anyone. If after strongly persuading my colleague to go, he or she still doesn't want to, I'd buck it up, so to speak, and go anyway.","I would sit with the feedback for awhile and assess if the feedback is truly accurate from a third person's perspective and to see if maybe I just got my feeling's hurt. If it turns out that I still feel like the negative feedback isn't an accurate assessment, then I would approach my manager and say, ""Listen, I want to talk to you about this feedback"" and present in a cool, detached manner why I think the feedback is incongruent with my performance.","I would first assess my personal and private workloads and time commitments. If I feel like I have some open time that won't interfere with my previous commitments, then, yes, I would volunteer for this project. I generally like learning about new cultures, and in particular, Norway has always intrigued me, so I would be willing to participate in this project. It sounds quite enjoyable and would break up the monotony of my other work."
10459832126,"I would consider what the reason for my colleague's request was. I would weigh that reason against my own. If mine was not that important, I would back down. Otherwise, I might try to force the issue by lobbying my supervisor or his or her superior to come up with another solution.","I would get going full blast on the project right away. I don't have much going on now, and my boss might give me something with a short turnaround time in the interim. I should use my time that I have now to get the project done to reduce stress and improve performance.",I doubt I would go. It's already been a long day and I'm not that into networking anyhow. Spending more time on work functions does not appeal to me. I value my free time.,"Obviously, I feel upset about the negative feedback. Usually I'd brush it off, but if I stand to lose a bonus, I'd probably object. I would most likely write an email explaining why I believe the feedback was false.","I would find it enjoyable. I enjoy studying other cultures and already have an interest in Norway. And it says I might not need to travel, but if there's a chance I might, that would be a bonus."
10459714577,"I would tell my colleague to change their plans or else I will destroy them.  I know I am physically superior to all my coworkers so this won't be an issue.  If they are smart, they will change their plans.",I would try to avoid my boss.  I will finish the project and avoid her bullshit waste of time tasks.  I like finishing important stuff and avoiding idiots.,I would go because there will probably be free food and beer.  I like to eat an drink.  I don't care about talking to people.,I would retain an employment attorney and sue her.  I've documented all her shit so her incompetence would be easy to prove.  I would enjoy ruining her.,I would find it enjoyable.  Norway generally has its shit together but is a tad too liberal.  They need someone like me there.
10459852320,"I would discuss with the colleague why they are unwilling to change.  Are they visiting a sick relative, going to a funeral, etc?  By discussing the situation, we could figure out who truly needs the time off now and who could wait.","I would try to get most of the light workload done as soon as possible.  Finishing most of the workload early could free up a bunch of time.  With my free time, I could finish any last minute projects without any stress or worry of meeting my deadline.","I would still go to the networking meeting.  Going to the meeting by myself won't prevent me from making new acquaintances.  By going to the meeting, I hope it shows my dedication and enthusiasm.",I would kindly approach my manager and ask them if we could discuss my negative feedback.  I would ask them why they felt that way and what can I do to improve myself.  The most important part is to approach my manager with a good demeanor and not attack or make accusations.,I would find this experience very enjoyable.  I love learning about other countries and cultures.  I find other cultures very interesting and would take this opportunity and run with it.
10459779228,"I would be willing to cooperate as long as it would not mean losing money. For example, I would definitely not be willing to change if I'd already purchased an airline ticket. Hotels are usually pretty good about switching room reservation dates, etc. It would be annoying, but I'd do what I could to work out the issue.",I wouldn't allow myself to become distracted worrying about my boss may or may not do. I always try to finish projects ahead of schedule anyway to give myself a buffer for final reviews. That would be my strategy in this case.,"I would not hesitate to go. I've worked in sales most of my life, these kinds of events are just part of the job. I prefer not relying on others anyway, so this would not be a problem for me.","I would first give myself some time to cool down and get recentered. Then I would get honest with myself and review the issue carefully. After that I would request a meeting with my manager to discuss the matter again. If I came to the conclusion the criticism was justified, I'd apologize; if I still felt I was in the right I would state my case calmly and respectfully.",I would LOVE to take on a project like this! I have traveled to many countries with my work and enjoy learning about different cultures. I would do everything possible to make this a winning project.
10459751309,"I would try to compromise with the employee. If their work is needed more or a lot more than my own, I would try to get compensated or use that factor to get my vacation. That would be the most reasonable.","I would try to finish what needs to be finished most. That said, I would try to reach out and tell my boss that the little jobs can be done, but they might be finished later than the current things that need to be finished. He would probably understand.","I would try to get my work friend to come. Even if he doesn't want to, I would try to compensate him in some way. There might even be things he can learn from this meeting.",I would try to discuss this matter with my boss. I'd listen to his concerns and see how we're able to reach another conclusion. That would be unfortunate to be in disagreement with each other.,I would find it enjoyable. Different cultures are always interesting. You don't always need to experience all things.
10446158182,"I would change my plans. You need to be flexible in a competitive market. I would not want to miss an opportunity to impress a superior, and show that I can be counted on in a pinch",I would spend all free time on the project. To attempt to get it done before any harder (last tasks) came up. Then even if it was not fully done I would be far enough ahead that all that would be left were finishing touches. That I could do in micro increments between difficult tasks.,"I would try and convince the colleague to go. I would tell them that the best way to farther your career is to be proactive, and to always be available and participate. If that did not work I would go alone, because you never know when an opportunity to grow as an employee might arise.","I would say, I can see how you might view things that way. I am sorry I gave you that impression somehow. I will try to make sure I give 100% in the future.","I would find it enjoyable. It would help in future dealings with a new culture. It would also make me vital on all future dealings with the project, which would give me job security."
10440120276,I would expect my colleague to change his vacation date because I chose that date before him.  The supervisor should double check and see I requested that week before him.,I would immediately start on the project so I would have a head start and possible get it done before my boss gave me any last minute tasks.,"Since it is one of our largest clients, I would still go to the meeting and introduce myself and be known.  Just because my colleague doesn't want to go should not stop me from attending the event.",Negative feedback is never a good thing and usually comes from coworkers who are jealous or have something they are out for.  I would have a private meeting with my manager and find out the facts and tell my side of the story.,I feel the experience would be interesting.  You would be learning about Norway and the different cultures and also making a friendly relationship with your client.  This would make things more comfortable if you have other deals with this client in the future.
10446129387,"I wouldn't mind taking my vacation at a different time. Such is the case, since I'd enjoy my job at least to the degree that I would very rarely desire a vacation. For these reasons and to keep a situation from needlessly escalating, I would just take my vacation at another time.","Since this project is due in two weeks and my workload is light,I would complete a project or 2, depending on what I had on my plate. I would then start on the new project that is due in 2 weeks, as I believe that I'd still be well ahead of schedule. This loose time period would allow me to cover any last minute tasks that my boss would throw at me. I would be jumping on immediately, as I know that I tend to procrastinate; so, getting right on the project is also curative training for myself, also, until I could heal myself of my tendency to procrastinate.","I would learn why my colleague was leaning towards not going. I would proceed to try persuading my colleague to go with me, since I would not otherwise know anyone. However, with my usually doing things alone, being somewhere where I did not know anyone would not be foreign to me. As such, I wouldn't be too bother, if my colleague preferred to skip out. I would then go alone and be as professional as possible, trying to learn as much information as possible, as it might benefit my company and help my career.","Initially, all of my senses would be tuned to detecting the reasons for my manager giving the negative feedback. If it is reasonable, I would propose ways to correct the issue that created the negative feedback. If I can understand the reason for the negative feedback, I would come to some sort of an understanding with my manager. If the reasons were for some sinister reason like discrimination or an unfair employment practice, I would just leave and plan on how I could defend myself administratively and judicially. I would also plan on some contingency out of it like trying to arrange for a transfer or getting a new job.","Since I've never been to Norway before, I would likely be more prone to finding this project enjoyable. I'd avail myself of this requirement and see it as an opportunity to expand upon my personal experiences. Of course, I'd learn a new experience. I would then proceed to systematically learn everything that I needed to know to successfully enter the country to at least complete my assigned project."
10462862586,"I would make every effort to change my plans.  If my vacation was extremely date specific, like a wedding or something, I would probably ask to randomly determine who gets the vacation or ask that it be given to the person with most seniority.",I would start working on the project immediately.  I have the free time right now and I'd rather get it done early and have free time later than wait on it and run out of time.  There are also many snags that can be hit on any project that can make it take a lot longer than expected.,"I would most likely pass on the meeting.  I am not a particularly social person, especially around strangers.  A job that required me to go meet with large groups of strangers all of the time is probably not going to work out for me long term.",I would try to resolve whatever he thought I was doing wrong.  I certainly wouldn't be happy but my manager and I are a team and if he doesn't like the work I'm doing something needs to change.   If I continue to feel like I'm doing quality work and he just doesn't agree eventually it means I need to find a new job.,"I would find this enjoyable.  I do like to learn about other cultures and getting to know your clients is a key item when it comes to being able to cater to their needs properly.  I would likely feel differently if it required a lot of travel, I prefer learning about new things more than actually doing them."
10459655596,"I would talk to my colleague again and see if there was any flexibility in their plans. I would also call my husband and see if there was any possible way to change our dates. I would try to work things out for the sake of all involved. But, I would probably not be real friendly with the co-worker who blatantly refused to consider changing plans.","I would gladly accept the project. I would also make sure to remind my boss that I would be busy with the project, so it might be a good idea to get someone else to pick up the slack, if needed. I would try to keep the peace and hopefully make my boss happy.",I would try to convince my colleague to join me and explain why. I would tell him/her that two heads are better than one and it would do us both good to meet the clients. It might help our careers.,"I would probably be pretty angry and ask for a meeting with the manager right away. I would get his/her side of the story and then express mine. I would let him/her know that my job is important to me and, while I respect their opinion, mine should be considered, as well.",I would enjoy this experience. I love learning about new things and places. I wouldn't find this boring at all and would relish the idea of perhaps visiting the country should the need arise to make the client happy.
10459726995,"I would be willing to change my vacation plans if I have not already booked my hotel and flight. Even if I have, I would then tell my colleague that I am willing to change my vacation plans if he/she would help me with an assignment in the future while I am on vacation. I think how I handle the situation would also depend on my relationship with my colleague.","I would try to get the project done as soon as possible. I would strive to complete it well before the deadline. I would do this because I wouldn't want to be surprised by extra work, and then struggle to complete the project at the last minute.","I would try to convince my colleague to go with me. I would explain to him/her that it is only fair that we both go. If he/she still does not want to, I would go on my own, but would ask that he/she return the favor at some point in the future.","I would probably be pretty devastated, worried, and angry. I would confront my manager. I would defend my work performance, but would do so politely and while communicating a desire to improve.",I would definitely find this experience enjoyable. I like learning about new countries and cultures. I would also take this opportunity to try to stand out as an employee.
10459949321,"I would tell my supervisor that I would change my plans. I feel like I need to be a cooperative worker and my supervisor would probably remember that I did what I could, in this case, to make things work out.","I would start on the project immediately. I feel that if I got it done as soon as possible, it would be less of a stress on me at the last minute.","I would go to the networking meeting. Being in a situation where I don't know anyone there wouldn't bother me. Since it is with one of our largest clients, it is important that someone goes.",I would take a reasonable amount of time to gather my thoughts on the situation. I then would meet with my manager and get to the root of the feedback. I would try to understand what had happened so I could either fix it or prevent it from happening in the future.,I would definitely find this project an enjoyable one. I like to learn about different cultures and customs from different places and I would find this part of my job to be highly interesting.
10459763915,I would let the colleague take the vacation. I would consider a different week. It would not be a problem. Work is more important than vacation time.,I would try to finish the project as soon as possible. I would reserve some time for the potential last minute task. I know that my boss can do it so I should be ready.,"I would try to persuade my colleague to go with me. I would press that the meeting is important to our work. If he refuses, I would go alone, it would not be a problem.","I would go to HR and file a complaint. If I believe that the negative feed back is not fair, I would not tolerate it. I am not a slave and I deserve fair treatment.",I would fined this experience enjoyable. I would certainly volunteer for the project. Norway is amazing and I would love to take part in a project related to it.
10440099578,"As long as I have not purchased airline tickets, I would change my trip. I would, however check with those that are vacationing with me. I try to be kind and flexible when possible.",I would definitely work on it now and not wait until the end of the two weeks. In anticipation of distractions from my boss I would also plan to work extra before the deadline. I try to give my self time to review and never procrastinate on a project.,"I would go. Although, it would be easier to go home, I am always up to meet people and this would look good for me to my client. Besides, you never know who you could meet.","Since this affects my bonus, I would ask for specifics regarding the feedback. Then I believe that I would document my side of the negative events so that there is a clarification for my actions. I would definitely address this to try to change the bonus and payout structure.","I would definitely volunteer. I love traveling to other cultures and would find learning about Norway very interesting. Plus, the knowledge may help with my job."
10459878208,"I would first look into changing my vacation plans. Most plans I make are fairly flexible and can be changed without very much effort. If I had already planned the vacation and it was nonrefundable or something, I would keep steadfast and probably ask the supervisor to determine the outcome.","I would make sure I spent as much of my free time as I could working on the project. Since my workload is light, I should have plenty of extra time to devote to it. My goal would be to have it done well ahead of schedule so that if some last minute tasks came up, I would have room to fit them in.","I would probably not go. I do not have a lot of need for networking in my personal job, and I am very introverted. If I didn't have anyone to go with, honestly, it probably wouldn't do me much good because I wouldn't do much interaction.","I would discuss it with my manager calmly and point out the inaccuracies that I see. If they gave a good rebuttal that I could understand, I would end it there. If they continued to give incorrect information that would result in damage toward me, I would take it to the next management level.",I think it would be very enjoyable and sounds like a lot of fun. I would like getting to know more about a different culture and being the point person for the new account on this sort of matter. I love learning about different cultures and people and this would be no exception.
10459871624,"I would tell my supervisor that I put that the request in first. I would also point to the fact of what I've contributed compared to the co-worker. Of course,  I would always make sure that I have contributed more.",I would ask my boss to try to hold off on any last minutes projects during the last week. I would explain that the project is important and I don't want to divert attention from it. I would also suggest providing additional help so I could wrap up the project early.,"I would probably just head home after work as well. There will be other opportunities to network. After a hard and long day, I would probably be better of skipping it anyway. I wouldn't be at my best.",I would have to talk to my manager about it. I would ask my manager to explain how they came up with the feedback. Then I would explain my position and explain why it wasn't true. Maybe that would resolve it and not cost me my bonus.,"I would definitely find that experience enjoyable. Learning about any of the Nordic countries would be interesting. Plus, if it could open the possibility of travel, that would be an added bonus."
10459894723,i would talk to my colleague and find out if he has already made plans for the vacation. i would enquire if he is going with his family or alone. i would change my date if he is going with his family as family comes first.,i would work after my work hours and finish off this project as my boss has assigned me the work. it is my responsibility to do what iam supposed to do.,i would tell him the importance of going to such meetings as it increases our contacts. i would tell him the pros of going there. i would even offer him free dinner.,i would talk with my manager one on one and try to fix the problem. i will probe what is wrong from my side.,i would find this enjoyable as iam ready to learn new things. i always had an interest to learn about other countries and their cultures.
10460294646,"I would see if their was a way that I could switch my vacation time. If it is easy for me to do so, then I would switch first. If there was no way for me to reschedule, I would talk to my coworker and see why they couldn't reschedule. I would try to work something out with that coworker, like switching other days or something similar.",I would try to finish my project as soon as possible. If I was confident that I could finish it in time I would want to do so. That way I would have time to do other tasks that might be assigned to me. If no other tasks are assigned then I could use my extra time to go over the project and make sure it's ready to go or I could use the time to start a new project.,"I would still go to the networking event. These events can lead to future business and are very important. Even though I won't know anyone there, the point is to meet new people are make new contacts. Since it is for a large client, I would feel obligated to attend.",I would try to have a one on one talk with my manager to address the negative feedback. If I thought it was incorrect then I would plead my case and try to have my manager understand my point of view. If my manager is steadfast in their belief that I did  something wrong then I would ask how I could improve to avoid negative feedback in the future.,"I would find the experience enjoyable. I like learning about new cultures, especially if it is good for my job. I would hope I would travel, because Norway would be fun to visit. I would happily volunteer for the project."
10460084354,"I would check in with my supervisor who actually made the request first and go from there. I believe whoever spoke with my supervisor first about it should definitely be the one who gets to take the vacation. Also, I honestly would like to find out whose vacation is more important in terms for the reason of the time off request.","I would definitely do all I can to finish the project before being due in two weeks. In doing so, it would better prepare me for any last minute tasks. Also, it is always best to be ahead than be behind in anything.","I would do all I can to convince or persuade my colleague to go, because it would definitely benefit both of us. My second option would be finding another colleague to go why actually has met and dealt with the client before. If not, then I would try to ask to reschedule for a another time if possible.","I would feel terrible. I would then ask what I need to do specifically to improve my working performance.  Also, I would make sure I express how determine I am to change and improve for the better, so my manager would see that that I truly care about my job.","I would think the experience to be enjoyable and interesting, because I would get to learn about another culture. I have never been to Norway or know much of anything about the people and its country. I honestly think it would be a good opportunity for me to learn and become more cultural in dealing with other people whom we never dealt with."
10459728076,"I would let the other worker take vacation. I don't usually have plans that can't be changed. This seems to be a 'let the baby have its bottle' kind of situation that you sometimes need to bite the bullet on in order to maintain a cohesive workforce. Still, I sure wouldn't forget this!",I would use some extra time to make sure the project was completed ahead of schedule. A boss that does things 'sometimes' is sure to do them at the worst possible moment in time. Better to expect it and get this thing done while expecting the worst.,"I would probably find a way to get out of it. I have some social anxiety issues and, while I can usually power through them, it would be incredibly trying. I would try to put pressure on my coworker to make sure they were attending.","I would think that it sucks. I would be angry. I would try to discuss this issue with my manager and plead my point of view as to why this feedback is incorrect. If it can't be changed, I would just have to live with it. Unless this manager has a record for off-base behavior, I wouldn't go over their head.","I would thing that this was an interesting experience. Norway is fairly foreign to me and has a long and varied history. It would be fun to explore this culture, even if only via textbook."
10459886224,I would not be willing to change if my coworker would not change.  I would have the supervisor make the decision.  I want the time off and should not have to not take it.,I would begin working on it and look to complete a first draft quickly.  During down time over a few days I would come back and make changes.  I would then look to finalize it shortly before it is due.,I would attend the gathering.  The point is to network and meet new people.  I would look to it as a good way to work with my client and search for new ones as well.,"I would confront the manager.  If I believe it not to be true, I would want more information.  If I am still not satisfied, I would go over their head to the next level of management with my issue.","I would find it enjoyable.  Learning about other countries has always been fascinating.  If I could get paid to work on a project where I could learn fun things, I would be very excited."
10459739526,"I would ask the colleague why they are not willing to change their plans. I would also ask them why I should change mine if they are unwilling? Perhaps this would force the colleague to think about the unfairness of refusing. Finally, I would come up with some random way of choosing who gets to take the week off (random number generator, drawing names from a bowl, etc), and ask the colleague if they agree to participate. If the colleague is dead-set on not changing their plans, then I would just accept this, but with the stipulation that I get the next vacation off regardless of their plans.","I would try to get as much done as I could at the beginning. I would be prepared to have other extra work towards the end of the due date of my project. If possible I would try to complete the project with time to spare, knowing my boss could give me a lot of time consuming near the end of the two weeks.","I would first try to convince the colleague to go with me, because we were invited by one of our biggest clients. I would tell my colleague that I wouldn't know anybody else there, and it would be good for the company's business relationship with the client if we went and mingled with them. If the colleague still did not want to go, I would suck it up and go by myself. I would make the best of the situation.","I would perhaps talk with a co-worker or colleague about the feedback (maybe in an indirect way if I didn't feel comfortable divulging that it was about me), to try and get a different perspective (perhaps I am missing the point of the feedback?) I would do my best to make changes corresponding with correcting the negative feedback. I would probably feel annoyed for a while. If the feedback persists, after I've tried to make changes, I would go to HR and ask them for help and advice.","I would likely try to take on this project, as I would find it interesting to learn about cultures and countries. Also, the prospect of maybe getting to travel is exciting to me. I like reading, researching, and talking with and meeting (and learning about) new people, so this project would be good for me."
10440110290,"I would only change my plans if I hadn't already scheduled anything. Otherwise, I would express to my boss the impossibility of me moving my vacation due to established plans. I would try to make this word as best I could for both myself and the colleague, but ultimately, my time and money does take priority.","I would try my hardest to start the project early. however, knowing myself, I would be likely to procrastinate a bit. I work best under pressure and saving things for a little bit down the line tends to be helpful in my productivity. I would try to get the hardest parts out of the way first in case my boss dropped something more hefty on my last minute.","I would go regardless of what my colleague said. Ultimately, they are not connected to me and, in fact, I would think that I would be better off navigating this without someone else. I'd encourage them to come, of course, because it is a fantastic opportunity; however, it would be important to me to attend regardless.","I would immediately schedule a meeting with my manager to talk about this negative feedback. I would try to have a calm, logical conversation with the manager, highlighting why this feedback shouldn't impact me. Ultimately, I know my work better than anyone else, and if need be, I would take it to a higher-up or HR. Losing a bonus for no real reason will not abide.","I would find this experience to be incredibly enjoyable. I am fascinated with the world around me and I would see this as an opportunity to expand my horizons. I would love to learn more about a country. I would love to travel as well, even if that wouldn't necessarily happen. I would absolutely volunteer."
10459763298,"This has actually happened to me more than once. Since the other colleague would not compromise, I have no choice but to change my plans. By doing so, my manager saw that I was more flexible and dedicated in deciding to go that route than my colleague is.","I would have a discussion with my boss and ask what other projects might be in the pipeline. If there are others coming, I would ask him/her to help me prioritize which are the most critical. I would then set out to complete those first and then continue with the others.",I would attend the networking meeting anyway. The main purpose of a networking meeting is to connect. So I would see this as an opportunity to meet people I do not already know and determine how we can benefit each other in the future.,I would be very upset but would try to remain calm in this situation. I would ask for specifics to ensure what went wrong and offer my own perspective. I would suggest how to turn the situation around to ensure that there is a positive outcome for everyone.,I would love to volunteer for this project. I have friends in Scandinavia and would reach out to them for input. I would be excited that there might be an opportunity to travel somewhere down the road if my input is valued. I also think it would be a nice and interesting diversion from my day-to-day activities.
10459750003,I would talk with the person and see what their plans on and compare them to mine. I would give in most likely and take it sometime else. I would make sure my boss knows I did this for the company.,I would get as much work as I can done now. I would then talk with my boss and make sure that each day I am updated on what I need. I would work careful and quickly on what I  need to get done.,I would make sure I do what I can for them to go with me. I will owe them a beer or two to go with me. It would make me better at my job and grow my network.,"I would have a sit down chat with them and see where the problem was. I would give my side to the story. This will hurt to do, but I need answers.",I would love to be part of this project. I love new cultures and would do all my research I needed. I need to help my company and this would be enjoyable to do.
10446126060,I will give up my vacation week because work is an important aspect of my life. this will make me give up my week for another time. I will enjoy my vacation more like that,I would take my time to finish his task as early as i am able to.  This is so that I get more time to go through my work and be more confident. this is also to create time for the unforeseeable tasks which may come up later,I would talk to my colleague into going. i will tell them how important it is for them to go and if they still do not go. i will go alone and make new friends,I will feel bad. I will try to bring my complaint up with my manager and know why he felt so. I will however promise to work harder and correct  where they felt i did not achieve  my goal,"I would find this experience very enjoyable. this is because i naturally like making new friends and learning new cultures. as i i teach this client about our cultures, i will learn of theirs as well"
10459905551,"I would most likely offer to take another week.  I would definitely be annoyed, but this has happened to me before and I had to take another week based on seniority.  I would remember the next time this came up and expect them to give up the week, but I would just take a different week.","I would start the majority of the work on the project now knowing I have a light workload currently.  I don't want to wait until the last minute.  I would expect my boss to give me last minute tasks, so would just start the project now.","I would ask my colleague to go with me again and hope they would change their mind.  If they still said no, I would most likely decide not to go because I don't like being in uncomfortable situations where I don't know anybody.",I would feel very upset.  I would try to think about what I could do to change the situation especially since I don't agree with the feedback.  I would consider going to HR and complaining because it affects my annual bonus.,I would be excited for this experience to learn new things about a new culture.   I would take on the opportunity with enthusiasm.  I would do whatever I needed to to be involved in the project.
10440105559,I would change my vacation plans to a different time and date.  I would be a little upset about it but would get over it pretty quickly.,I would remind my boss of the big project I have due in 2 weeks and let him know I need to spend my time working on it the most I can.,"I would be nervous, but would go alone anyway.  I wouldnt want to miss out on the opportunity.",I would feel nervous  about expressing my feelings on the given feedback   I would worry about the repurcussions.,I would find this enjoyable.  I like to meet new people and it would be interesting.
10440118814,"If my plans were not set in stone, I would change my plans. It can be beneficial to accommodate others, as well as make it clear where we stand and I might get a better price on my vacation","I would finish the project first  because the easier it is, the better it is to get it out of the way.  I would rather be done early and have the time to give the other tasks my full attention.  It could be disastrous otherwise.",I would go to the networking event. Things like this can be beneficial. It always feels better to make new friends and get something out of there.,"I would feel horrible. Situations like this barely work to suit anyone. Instead of pouting and getting upset, I would ask my manager to discuss things point by point so we could have a conversation about the feedback and work to correct it",I would find this experience fascinating. I like learning about new cultures. I like seeing the world outside my small bubble.
10440103877,"I would change my vacation plans. I am more than capable of being the bigger person. Besides, it looks better for me to be flexible in my job responsibilities.","I would try to work more efficiently to accomodate my increasing workload. If that is not possible, then I would have to delegate some of the smaller tasks to someone else. I would do this because one person can't do everything.",I would do my best to assure them that they are important to the success of this meeting. I would also point out that this meeting could help to boost their own career. I would do this because I feel uncomfortable in a room full of strangers.,"I would feel very upset, even picked on. I would begin looking for a way to prove my innocence. Once I was proven correct, I could hold my head up again.",I would probably enjoy learning about another country. I've never travelled outside the US before. I think Norway has a lot to offer in terms of original ideas.
10440108952,"I would let him take the vacation.  I rarely take vacation anyway.  I only take vacation when my PTO hours are capped and I was gonna lose them at the end of the year if I didn't use them.  So in that case, I would cash out my PTO and let him have the vacation.","I would try to predict what my boss would want from me in the last minute.  I work in software, so this kind of stuff happens all the time.  I'm usually pretty good at writing my code so it can easily change to accommodate last minute changes.",I would still go so I can meet new people who can help me get ahead in life.  Meeting clients from a large company is always a good idea.  I would tell my colleague he can leave and I will make the meeting myself.,I would discuss with my manager about the negative feedback.  I would try to explain myself.  I would tell him what I will do better from this day forward.  I will say anything to keep my bonus.,I would find this experience annoying.  I would not volunteer to go.  I already have enough on my plate and this seems to add a lot more to it.  I would definitely do all that is possible to avoid it.
10440098466,I would try to find a compromise between the two of us. Maybe split the weeks between us. Or if I had nothing planned I would try and switch my time.,I would attempt to work on the project a little each day. The worst that can happen is getting it accomplished before the deadline. This way if any unannounced projects come up it won't get in the way of completing this task.,I would try and convince my colleague to attend because it would be a great opportunity. If my colleague still declined the invitation I would still go myself. Networking is an important part of moving through the corporate world.,"I would take their opinions into consideration. Sometimes your boss doesn't understand to the fullest extent of what goes on. Take what they said and try to improve on some area, even though you may not agree with their opinions.",I would find this experience to be enjoyable. I love to learn about new cultures and distant places. If the timing was right traveling there would be neat as well.
10459658267,"I would most likely be upset, understandably.  If I had my vacation already planned, then there's no way that I would change my plans.  I am a fairly non-confrontational person, so I would try and work out a compromise between myself and my colleague.","I would dedicate my time to finish the project three to five days in advance.  I'm the type of person who likes to work and and motivated to complete my work.  It would be wise to complete the project a little earlier than the due date, just in case the boss drops a last minute task.","I would most likely go.  I assume that most people there wouldn't know each other, which is why they are networking.  I would want to meet new people to discuss work related ideas.","I would be upset.  I would first confront my manager, to see why I got the feedback that I did.  I tell the manager that I don't agree with his assessment.  If the manager doesn't agree,  I will try to have one of my colleagues corroborate for me to see if that helps.","I would find it both boring and enjoyable.  On one hand, I'll likely have to learn all these things on top of my other work.  I would enjoy learning about other cultures and the country of Norway.  If i get to travel there, that's just an added bonus."
10460085769,"I would be flexible and see if my plans would be able to be performed on another week.  I hate conflict and I would see if we could negotiate something where I would plan something on another week, but he would have to respect my plans and change weeks if the same thing happened again.",I would try to tackle it quickly and probably would work on it on the weekends to get it done.  The worst would be to almost have it finished and then not be able to get it done because of extra work that is added at the last minute.,I would convince my colleague to go by having me pick the tab up for dinner and tell him that we will leave early together.  I don't want to be there any more than he does..but we both need to be there as a job obligation. I bet that he would end up coming with me..knowing that I have no intention of staying later and I will be staying close to him during the meeting.,"I would be really frustrated with the negative feedback. If I honestly feel that the feedback isn't merited, than I would speak with my manager, Maybe he has incorrect impressions and needs to have clarification brought upon through a scheduled meeting.  It would be a tragedy if an annual bonus wasn't given simply because communication didn't happen.","I would really find the job interesting because I find learning about other cultures fascinating.  There would always be the possibility that with a new client there may be the option to travel.  And..if you know more about the country, it would be that much easier to have a dialogue with the client and make them feel more at ease.  I feel that it would be noted your acquired knowledge of Norway and you may be put on more projects that involve the client."
10446109739,I would convince her that mines been plan.  I would tell her I can't get a refund for my vacation  I would say its a family trip,I would not try to add more work on me.  I would try to avoid more work.  I would hope she doesn't give me more,I would go to the meeting still.  I would share with my colleague what I learn.  I would talk them in to going to the meeting.,I would turn the negative into positive.  I would let the manager know that not true.  I would try to understand the consequence,I would find it enjoyable.  I would help the company find great things.  I would travel if i really have to.
10459993430,"I would gladly exchange my time for my colleague's vacation.  However, I would expect, and would discuss, that my colleague must reciprocate sometime in the future, in the form of an I.O.U.  I would not make a big issue out of it, as I am not a vacation person.  I would also take a 'spot me' payment, in the form of a free lunch, or other courtesy.","I would handle this situation by going to my boss daily, and talking to him or her.  I would explain my schedule and how I think things are coming along with the project.  I would then ask what he or she thinks the upcoming busy work looks like for the week ahead.","I would go, and make sure to put on a kind, professional face for the company.  I would, perhaps, explain that my colleague regrettably could not attend.  I would try to enjoy myself, because usually, I find that unexpected events turn out to be the most memorable.","I would be slightly angry about this situation.  However, I would ask as many questions as possible to get to the bottom of what I could do to improve.  I would ask my colleagues if they know anything afterward, and if they were evaluated in a similar manner, in order to gain more information.","I would find this situation very enjoyable and volunteer.  First, this is a great opportunity to advance your career.  However, I would first think far ahead, because you don't want to volunteer with too much on your plate at any one time."
10449255347,"I would consider a lot of different things. Is this colleague somebody I like? Do I work with them regularly? Do I interact with them socially? Are they higher or lower than me in the organization. The week of vacation I requested, is there a reason I needed that specific week? Is it because my wife managed to get that time off? The answer to what I'd do largely depends on the answers to those questions. If I had flexibility I'd try to be a team player but if there would be little organizational blowback on me and my wife couldn't get other time off I'd probably fight for the time. Especially if I requested the time off.",If your boss has a tendency to throw unexpected work at you then it makes sense to plan around it with the expectation that it will likely occur. I would likely use my lighter workload in the present to work ahead on the project due in two weeks. In most jobs it's impossible to really project your workload perfectly so you take advantage of the low times to get ahead on things that may bite you later.,"I would attend the networking meeting, especially if your colleague isn't going. I would be up front with my colleague though, explaining that at least one of us should be there. They're a pain but often part of the job even if not explicitly required. It's hard to put a price on a solid client relationship.","I would passive aggressively update my resume and spend a little time looking for another job. I probably wouldn't act on it but it's nice to feel like I have options. And I frequently don't agree with negative feedback but it can still sometimes be right. At the very least, it means that somebody perceives you differently than you perceive yourself, so it can still be a good opportunity to reconsider how you perform your job. Is it wrong because somebody was missing information? Perception of performance is often more important than actual performance so even feedback you disagree with is very actionable. But also consider they may be making a paper trial to let you go. If you feel that's the case it's better to look for a job while you have one rather than wait until you're unemployed.","I would likely find this to be a positive experience. Honestly, the fact that it doesn't necessarily imply travel means that you likely could travel if you wanted to. Free trip to Norway. Broadening your experience at work is a good thing and if you're the only one with that expertise it makes you even more valuable. You're being paid to work and part of your compensation is by growing as an employee. Taking on a task that will reward you with new skills and expertise is always better than doing something routine, repetitive, and won't grow your expertise."
10459913762,"In that instance, I would ask our supervisor to allow whoever placed their request in first to be able to make the final decision. The supervisor needs to put their big girl pants on and be a boss instead of causing adversity between you and your coworker. I would not approach my coworker about it as it is not my place.","If the project is due in two weeks, but I feel that my boss is going to throw me a curb ball last minute, I would go ahead and start working on the project. I would want to complete the project ahead of schedule so that I would be prepared for any craziness my boss tries to hand me the day before. That would be how I handled it.","If it is one of my largest clients, I might end up going to the event if only for a little while. I would not want it to appear that we did not care for our client by not going. If my partner did not seem like they would go then this would be even more important.","It wouldn't be easy, but I would have the manager give my feedback to me in written form so that I would have time to go over it and really think about and type a response out. This way I could meet with him or her soon thereafter to discuss the negative feedback and give my response. I would be quite angry, but knowing myself, I would need time to process and handle in a dignified manner.",I would find this experience enjoyable. I enjoy learning new things and would love to be able to impliment what I learned with the client. It could also open up some doors for me to travel in the future.
10459664168,"It would depend on what my plans were. If I had tickets to go somewhere, I would not be willing to change plans and would insist that whoever asked for the time off first should be the one who gets it.",I would do my best to get the project done early. I would not wait until the last minute to do the work. I would plan for the extra projects that the boss could give me and make sure that I have the time needed to complete.,"I would make plans to go, whether or not the colleague planned on going. It is important to go to the events of our largest client. I am strong enough a person to go by myself.","I would do my best to prove that the information was wrong. I have plans for my annual bonus, and it is very important to me that I am judged fairly, based on what I do or do not do. I don't like negative feedback that I did not earn.","I would find it very enjoyable. I like finding out about different countries and cultures. I am good at research, and would love to find out as much as possible about the country involved."
10440104708,"I am flexible most of the time, if I could change my plans I would. If not then I would like to have the freedom to work remotely if my plans can't be changed. If I have to go on a vacation on a different time, perhaps my boss could give me a day or two extra for vacation.",I would carefully size up the project to make sure I can complete it in due time. In case it requires more time that I can spend then I would put all other tasks aside since this one has a two weeks due date. I would also inform my boss in that case that I would be dedicated full time to this new project only.,"I would like to go since this is an important meeting with an important client. In fact this opportunity would make me stand out in management's eyes, so I really don't have a choice but to go.  May be management would give me a bonus or some extra time off it meeting goes well.","I would think of that as a excuse, since sometimes bosses  just make up excuses to pad up their own figures.  However if his accusations are verified by some other sources then obviously I would have to look at myself. In that case I would try to do better next time so I can get my bonus.  In the end it is after all a bonus and  not a guarantee money.",I would find this experience enjoyable since I am a little adventurous and like challenges. I wouldn't even mind travel to Norway to learn about the country and their culture in person.  Little things like saying Thank You in the native language could go a long way in building relationships.
10460200875,"I would not change my vacation time if I was the first to submit it. I would not mind changing my vacation time if I didn't have a vacation planned and booked, but if I submitted my request for time off first, and I booked a vacation, I would refuse to change it. I would have to talk with the supervisor if my coworker was being disagreeable. I don't think it would be fair if I requested first.","I would be sure to take care of this project immediately. That would be in my best interest, especially while my workload is light. I wouldn't want to put it off and then be bombarded with multiple projects at the last minute. It's better to be proactive and to get things done.","I would go whether my colleague was going or not. This is a great opportunity to advance my career. I may consider taking my spouse if it's appropriate, but I am not ashamed in going alone and meeting new people. This is an opportunity I wouldn't miss.","I would speak with my manager directly. I think it would be important to find out why I received this review. If it was not deserved, I wouldn't want my job to be affected. If it was deserved, I'd want to know what I could do to fix it.",I would find this task to be interesting. I would probably ask to be a part of it. It would be intersting to learn about another country and to meet someone from there. This may also open the opportunity to have the chance to go to Norway in the future.
10440401305,I'd change my plans & allow them to go. I wouldn't be thrilled with it but I'd be the bigger person. I'd also look at it like they owe me a favor as well.,I would work hard & make sure I had time just in case my boss sprang any surprises on me. I'd also try to communicate more with my boss to avoid any major surprises. Knowing what's on his/her mind would help.,I would try to convince them to change their mind. I'd stress to them how important it was to me & ask them to reconsider. If they still wouldn't go I'd go to the meeting but I wouldn't be happy with my colleague & I would keep it in mind if they ever needed my help.,I would be mad & frustrated. I'd try to change their opinion if possible. Not a whole lot you can do really. Maybe I'd start looking for a better job.,I would find it very enjoyable. I like to learn about other cultures & am naturally curious. It would be a challenge but I enjoy them.
10440104155,"If i am able to change weeks I would. However if I am not able to, then we would ave to discuss it. I feel whoever put the vacation time in first should get the week off. If we still can't come to a compromise then let the supervisor decide.","Knowing my boss can throw a curveball at me at anytime, I would get my project done as soon as possible. I am going into it anticipating that my boss will give me something else to make my 2 week deadline harder to get. So get it done as soon as possible to avoide any further problems.","You should go, this is a great opportunity to get to know one of our biggest clients. Not only that a chance to get to know others that could potentially be a future client. This is your chance to get ahead in the company. I don't think you'll get a better opportunity this year to make an impact.",I would feel real bad and wouldn't allow it to go without saying anything. I would talk to the manager and tell him how I disagree with the feedback. As It can carry consequences I must be discussed. I would want to know his reasons for it and want a chance to give my side. I can't stand things not being set right in life. That literally eats away at me. It must e discussed.,I would do it. Starting when I was young I always likes learning about other places and cultures. So I'm not worried about having to do extra on the project.
10446121716,"It would depend on whether my vacation plans were flexible. If no one else's schedule were impacted by a change in dates, I would report to my supervisor that, on this occasion, I would be happy to be flexible in order to ensure that everything is covered. If there were a reason why I needed the vacation during that particular week, I would give the supervisor my reason for needing the vacation that week and ask him/her to make a decision.",It's a good thing that I have observed a pattern in my boss's behavior. I would use that to my advantage by trying to get an early start on the project. I might talk to colleagues about helping me if the boss does pile on additional work right before the deadline. I would probably have a discussion with the boss beforehand to specifically request no significant additional tasks prior to the two week deadline.,"As an introvert, this is a tough one for me. I know that I would probably not enjoy the event. If I were committed to that job and organization and felt that I could perform as needed socially, I would go. On such occasions I tend to remind myself that there is a reason why it is called a ""job""  and not ""play"". I would view it as a personal challenge to overcome my introversion so that it did not hold me back professionally.","If he feedback were oral, I would request that I have that feedback in writing. I think people become much more careful with their words when committing them to writing. Having something concrete (written) would also help when trying to build a case for the inaccuracies in the feedback. If it were part of a written performance evaluation, I would write a response presenting my perspective.","I would love tackling a project such as this. I enjoy learning about different cultures and to be paid to do so would be a pleasure. I don't have any particular connection to Norway, but it sounds like an interesting task. I wouldn't mind travel as a part of the task!"
10460099569,I would talk to them and see if we could come to an understanding. I would be willing to move my vacation but only with another negotiation. I would do this because I want to be an agreeable person but also have boundaries.,I would handle this project by making sure I get on the project early just in case my boss decides to add on an additional project at the last minute. I would do this because it would prevent me from being overwhelmed.,I would likely not go to the networking event if my colleague does not go. I would not be comfortable with the idea of going to an event that i do not know anyone there. I would not go because my comfort level is better having someone else there that knows me; we could help each other out with introductions and talking with new people.,"I would calmly and rationally ask to meet with the manager to discuss the feedback. I would avoid getting upset, but also stand my ground with them about the feedback. Hopefully we could come to an understanding where the feedback does not have any negative consequences. I would feel annoyed about this situation but would feel better about having a plan of action.",I would find learning about a new country and culture very interesting and would love to be involved with this project. I like meeting new people and assimilating new information. I also consider myself a people person and could understand the differences between other cultures and my own.
10460209018,"I would first want to know the plans of my colleagues to judge whether it was something of great importance like a graduation, wedding or sadly the death of a loved one. If they plan on just going camping or to like an amusement park, I would defend my time requested off, which in this scenario does sound like I was granted BEFORE said colleague. If their plans were so important, why didn't they make them sooner (even say a wedding, although I would make an exception because it's not their day they would be ruining), unless (again) it was an emergency such as a death.","I would let my boss know that my project would need to take precedence unless the tasks were of the utmost importance. I believe that prioritizing your work load is going to look better than being late on your project. I would also consider asking for assistance or even approaching my boss with time management idea's, which in turn might hint at the need for more time.",I would ABSOLUTELY go! My colleague does not pay my bills or have an influence over my future. I can and will not dictate my professional life over personal relationships.,"I would want an immediate explanation as to why  they felt that way, and would want everything documented. It seems that my manager has negative intentions regarding me and my position.","I would find this experience incredibly enjoyable because Norway is one of the most beautiful countries in the world! The hiking alone would keep me in sheer joy the entire time, having the trip be free is just an added bonus."
10462968759,"I would decide to let my colleague go on vacation first. I would want to keep the peace at work. Also, I just would not mind waiting a little bit longer to go on vacation.","I would try to get some of it done a little each day. That way, I will be more likely to get it done on time. Also, if I feel like I am falling behind with my work, then, I would probably ask one of my colleagues for help.","I would probably not go. Since I wouldn't know anyone there, I would probably feel a bit uncomfortable. Also, if the meeting is not mandatory, then, I would probably feel like I don't HAVE to go.","I would try to talk to my manager about everything, and if I feel as though the feedback isn't true, then, I would probably try to give my manager proof that the information isn't true. I would hope that my manager would change my feedback so that it is not so negative. Overall, I think I would just go in with a good attitude and hope for the best.","I would find the experience to be enjoyable. I love to learn new things. Also, with the things I learn about the country and its culture, I could share the information with my friends."
10440101960,I would let the  manager decide based on performance. If I perform better I should get the week that I want. If I am not the better performer I think it is fair for the other to get the week.,I would go ahead and get the project done. It is better to be ahead of your work . If you get more work you are prepared to get that finished as well.,I WOULD GO BECAUSE IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO NETWORK. THE EVENT MAY LAND ME AN OPPORTUNITY THAT I WILL MISS BY NOT GOING. THERE MAY BE A JOB OPPORTUNITY AND I MAY MEET SOMEONE THAT CAN HELP ME IN MY CURRENT ROLE.,"I would talk to my manager about the feedback. I would ask if there was something that I can do to to change the feed back given, I would also explain why I do not believe the feed back is right. If I do not get any where I will speak to another member of management.",I would not find it enjoyable. It would be difficult to work on a project with people and never having met face to face. I think it would be a good idea to meet at least once.
10440098915,"Well it would depend how flexible I am in my own vacation.  If I haven't bought tickets or made reservations; and my wife hasn't done any of the same, I could potentially move my vacation.  If those things are set in then I would fight for the spot.",I would try to crank out as much of the project during my light work load as possible.  This would allow me to be able to handle the last minute work from my boss without any major issues.  Added bonus if the extra work never came then I could be lazy later.,I would still go to the meeting.  That would be a good way to engender good will with the client and look good to my bosses.  Added bonus in my experience there is usually food at those types of meetings.,"I would feel pretty bad about the situation, angry even.  I would talk with my boss and express my disagreement, and if I felt it was serious enough I may go to my bosses boss to complain.",I would find this experience enjoyable.  I enjoy foreign cultures and learning about them and learning their language.  As an added bonus I have nordic heritage that it would allow me to learn more about.
10440102629,"I would ask about who has worked longer and go with that. If my colleague has been there longer then me, then I will change my vacation plans. I would expect them to do the same.","I would complete the project right away. That is how I work. If I have time to spend om myself or other projects after I have completed this one, then that is a bonus to me.",I would go. This is a networking meeting and I would like to build my network. One of my largest clients would help me build that network.,I would ask my manager for more feedback. I would like examples to show the negative feedback. This may effect my bonus and I do let things go that easy.,I would find it enjoyable. Learning about new about new places and culture is all about my wonderlust. Full of exciting new things.
10440118614,"It would honestly depend on the plans I had made.  If i had a ticket that I had purchased on plans that had costed me money, I would not be willing to change my plans.  If I did not have definite plans and were taking more of a staycation, I would be willing to change with my colleague.",I would do my best to work hard and get the project out of the way.  This would leave time in order to handle any task my boss threw my way.  It would also free up time to go back and review my work on the project and make any necessary last minute changes.,"I am not the best at networking, so I would not want to go without my colleague. I tend to get very shy and even say things that do not make sense when I'm nervous.  It would pain me to be there without someone I did not know.","I would be very upset if it was something that was unreasonable.  I would send my boss a meeting request to further discuss their feedback.  If needed, I may go one step ahead and go to HR or my boss's boss.",I would find this experience enjoyable.  I enjoy learning about different cultures and I do not know anything about Norway.  Learning about how they interract with other countries and eachother would be exciting.
10440111393,I would lobby to my supervisor about why I should get the vacation over them. I would also make a point to outwork my colleague over the next few weeks. If that didn't work I would start looking around for new jobs.,I would handle this project with as much attention as possible. I know I can get the job done. I just have to dedicate my schedule to it.,"I would ask around to see if anyone else at the firm wanted to go with me. If that didn't work, I'd ask my manager to tell me what he knows about the people at the meeting. Then I'd go alone and try to make connections.","I would try to work on the feedback to see if I could change his opinion. I would also ask my manager productivity oriented questions such as ""what would be a better way to do this"". I would personally feel disappointed he does see things my way and would most likely start looking for new jobs no matter what.",I would find this experience enjoyable. I enjoy learning about other countries and cultures. I also think it could be useful if I go there in the future.
10462927102,"I would ask my supervisor to have a meeting and discuss the conflict with the three of us.  I would like to discern if there is a chance to change vacation plans.  I would go into the meeting with an open mind, and would consider changing my vacation.","I would start the project immediately, considering other work related matters.  I would give my boss executive summary updates two days, with an agreement of the status of the project and his ideas of the progress towards the goal.","I would go, as it is an opportunity to meet an important contact and to continue to strengthen a relationship with an important client.  I would leave at the earliest possible moment.","I would say I understand his point of view, and work on the issues related to his feedback.  I would mention to him that I would like to review my progress towards his comments on a weekly basis.","I would find the project interesting and enjoyable, as I like the opportunity to learn how other countries get things done.  I especially like the fact that very little travel is involved."
10440117504,"I would pick a different week. I don't think waiting another week or two would effect me very much. Also, the colleague might have family constraints.",I would start working on the project early. I would try to finish the majority of the work atleast a couple days before it is due so I do not get stuck. Then if I get other tasks closer to the deadline I will have time to finish both.,"I would not go because I am very introverted. It would be awkward and not fun if I did not know anyone else there. Even though it could be beneficial to my career, I would be too anxious to go.","I would feel angry and upset. Since it effects my job, I would ask to have a meeting to discuss the feedback. I would explain my case, but also really listen to his explanation. Maybe I am being defensive and there is some truth to the feedback.","I would find this experience very enjoyable. I think learning about different cultures is fun and interesting. People have different ways of thinking, different foods, and hobbies. It is nice to know something about them. Even if I don't get to visit, I'm better off because I learned something new."
10440113995,"I would change my vacation plans and agree to work that week. I would also tell my colleague that I changed my plans for him or her. I will note this incident, so that I could refer to it at a later time.",I would get as much work done now while my workload is light. This way if my boss gives me other projects to do; I will have time to work on them. I would want to show my boss that I am dedicated to the company and a team player.,I would tell my colleague that he or she has an obligation to attend the networking meeting. I would also say that he or she is doing me a disservice by not going. I would still attend the meeting even if my colleague did not because it would reflect poorly on me not to.,I would be upset. I would contact my manager and arrange a meeting to discuss the reasons I believe that the feedback was inaccurate. I would compile a list of all the positive things I did for the organization and have it read when I met with the manager.,I would probably find the experience interesting as my family has some ties to Norway. I would volunteer to be part of the project. I would gather some information about the culture regarding food and religion before the project started.
10440099190,I would change my week of vacation with no problem. I'm easy to get along with and work with...however... I will expect the coworker to reciprocate in the future. And I would probably be leary of them for being such a hardass about changing their vacation.,I would get right on this project. Putting it off till the last minute would be counterproductive in that I may end up rushing and fowling it up. Especally if my boss drops a last minute task on me. I like to get work done ahead of schedule and have the decks cleared for my next task.,"I would still go. This is an important client, and I wouldnt miss the opportunity to sit down and network with them. Not knowing anybody wouldnt bother me at all if it is work related.","I would really look at what his feedback says. Is it true, what could I have done better, what is he seeing that I'm missing. These are building blocks to working better and improving. I would then ask to sit down with him again to discuss the situation.",I would probably pass up the opportunity to work on the project. I dont want to get myself in over my head in regards to a new client in an unfamiliar market.  It might not grab my attention enough to want to learn more about the culture of Norway or be a significant help to the project.
10446118358,"I would definitely explain that it's as if the co worker is daring challenge my schedule, they are not going to step on me either. I would also tell the colleague that it should be, or have been discussed beforehand especially that they can't just expect people to abide by their personal wishes. It's simply wrong to do such without considering some type of consultation about the variable ways to work something through for everybody. I'd be very flexible if spoken to before making such an arrangement. Expectations do not always succeed because of ""greed"" in many different ways.","I would definitely use more effort in getting everything done even if it meant longer hours and less sleep. There is a goal that must be met and if failing that goal, it might be costly in the long run based on the effort. Even if it's not accomplished I can easily prove humanity can only do so much in a certain amount of time.","I wouldn't pass on the opportunity so even if I didn't know a person, I see this as a possible promotion. If a colleague decided not to go I see that person passing by a big opportunity and might actually regret it for themselves. I would still try encourage that the co worker also go and describe the same as it being a big opportunity that might just pass right by and not available again soon. I'd also let them know, I'm going whether you're going or not, which might actually encourage the other to go with me. If not, it's too bad for them cause I'm not stopping.","I would begin with a very low tone explanation on why I felt it was not negative and lean towards asking questions on why exactly is it that the manager doesn't see it fit. I would explain my effort given towards it and possibly modify my behavior, but if it was becoming too offensive and leaning towards discrimination I would probably speak with others about it. Looking at how everybody sues everybody over such little petty bogus and still win lawsuits, may as well take advantage of the others that dare take advantage of me.","I would find it interesting that even if I cared less about that country, I would care about this opportunity for myself. Sometimes doing something new and different might be worth taking the chance. Especially that if I might not need travel it makes it even more interesting and not being so ""inconvenient"" in the project. I can easily see this as another opportunity that could turn into another way of getting promoted."
10462973582,"I would speak to my colleague and ask what her plans were. If I had a very important function to attend or had booked a vacation, I would fight for my right to take it the same time if she could not rearrange her plans. If I did not have plans, then I would give that week to my colleague.","I would take one task at a time. I would do my regular work first, and then I would take on the project. I would utilize time management skills to complete the task.","I would plan on attending the meeting. If it is my largest client, then I need to attend for their business. It would not matter to me if I did not know anyone.","I would think about the situation and sleep on it. If after I thought about it, I still believed to be right, I would gingerly approach the subject with my boss. It would depend on her attitude whether I proceeded with my thoughts or not.","I would find it boring. It sounds more like work to me than fun. It sounds like homework. I love to travel and learn about cultures but, researching it would not be my idea of fun."
10460299098,"I would first arrange a time to privately meet with this colleague. In this meeting, I would plan to discuss our vacation plans. I would want to know why he/she absolutely must take his/her vacation during this week. If my vacation is flexible and his/her is not, of course I would offer to take my vacation during another week without a problem. If my vacation is not flexible either, I would try to discuss this further with this colleague to work out a compromise.","I would sit down with my boss to discuss the need for fewer or no other tasks to be assigned during the time in which I would be working on this project. If my boss had a problem with this request, I would assert that the quality of the major project I was assigned to would likely be lower if I were forced to occupy my time with other tasks. This would especially be true if these tasks are mentally exhausting.","I would likely not attend either. Since I would be exhausted, I would not be in the state of mind to interact with new people. I would politely let whoever invited me know this reason for not attending.","I would first talk directly with my manager to understand more about the negative review. If he/she gives me this information and I still do not agree with the assessment, I would then talk to the manager of my manager (if he/she has one) and tell them that this assessment was unfair. If my manager has no manager, I would talk to individuals higher up the corporate ladder about this.","I would love to be a part of this experience. I have always wanted to visit Norway, and learning about its culture would be an added bonus that should accompany a visit anyway. I would essentially view this offer as a valuable learning experience from which I could grow."
10440098367,"I would ask them what they were doing on their vacation.  If it was something important like a child's wedding or a birth and I didn't have important plans, I would let them go.   If I had important plans and they didn't I would explain to them and to my boss that my plans were too important to switch.","I would get as much of the project done as soon as possible. While the workload is light I have extra time to put in on the project that I might not have later on if the boss gives me extra work, it won't matter because I will be done or almost done with the project.","I would remind them that it was a good opportunity to network and tell them that we should go.  I would tell them I really want them to go so I wouldn't be alone.  If they still didn't want to go, I would go by myself.",I would be upset. I would go back in mind and try to figure out what they saw as negative.  I would ask them what I did wrong. Then I could fix the situation in the future.,"I would volunteer to be involved on the project. I think it would be interesting to learn about a new culture.  Norway seems interesting, but I don't know much about it."
10441717471,"I would try to make concessions for my colleague, but I would have them do some of my work in exchange.  I feel that I would need to be compensated for making such an accommodation for them.  I would be sure that the next time we were up for vacation I was able to get first choice.",I would try not to assume anything as assumptions can bring on anxiety.  I will try to separate the workload into specific tasks and make a list so I could get them all done.  I would remain confident in my ability to take on any task as a motivating force.,I would still attend the meeting if I was in this situation. I think that it would be a great opportunity for me to Advance my career and I would not want to let someone else's complications hinder my  advancement.  I would feel that it was very important for me to show that I was loyal and dedicated to the company despite any complications.,I would feel that I have let myself down on the situation.  I would be curious as to what I could do to fix the situation or if there was anything that I could do it all.  It would be hard for me not to think about the consequences or do well over what I had done to get into this situation in the first place.,I would find this experience really enjoyable because I like  to learn more about different people and places.  I would look at it  as an opportunity to  spread my wings and diversify my knowledge.  I have always been curious  about my surroundings so this would be  a great way to  Harbor my creativity.
10459778718,"I would change my plans.   I am a teacher, so I have the whole summer off.  I dont like going anywhere for vacations.",I would start the project right away.  It looks better to get things done earlier.   I wouldn't wait to do the task.  I would portion it out to get it all done.,I would go because it'd make me look good.  I would encourage them to go and tell them I'd be there.  I would support them there if they went.,I would ask them where they found a weakness.  I would identify when I do that correctly.  I would ask them for advice of how to get better in that area.,I would find it very interesting.  I love to learn and i'd love to learn more about any place.   I would take virtual tours and love it.
10462856179,I would try to discuss with my co-worker what our vacations plans were. I would try to determine if either of us had already paid for the vacation. I would also try to see if either of us had made plans that would affect other people if we had to cancel travel. Then I would try to come up with a solution based on the information received.,I would continuously work on the project. I would tackle small bits at a time to make sure that it is finished before the due date. This would ensure my ability to complete all other tasks including unforeseen tasks to the best of my ability.,"I would first try to convince my colleague to join us. I would explain that it would be a benefit to us both individually as well as to the business. If they still did not want to attend, I wouldn't pass up the opportunity solely because I didn't know anyone. I would take the opportunity to go, and introduce myself to the clients.","I would feel upset and anxious about this situation. I would calmly ask the manager for proof of their claims, and let them know that such a strong claim could potentially have negative consequences on my livelihood. If the claims did turn out to be correct I would ask for direction to better my performance.","I would find this experience extremely enjoyable. I would love to get paid to learn about a new culture while taking on a new deal with a client. It would be even better if travel was involved, but the learning experience alone would be fascinating."
10459730914,I would first discuss the situation with my husband and see if he could also change his vacation week. I would then make it known that I was willing to change my vacation week to my boss and colleague. I believe this would help my connections and reputation in the office overall. I do not think it would be a huge sacrifice on my part as I would have enough time to re-plan the vacation.,I would walk very hard now to complete as much of the project as I can. I am aware that other projects can come up and I will remind myself to remain calm if and when it does. I will remain diligent in getting the project done in advance of the deadline.,"I would go to the networking meeting. While I may be tired and not knowing anyone there, I will remind myself how valuable this opportunity may be for my career. I would focus on the positives and the good that could come from the event.",I would feel very confused and upset in this situation. I feel like my work has been of the highest quality and I have not received negative feedback like this before. I would try to have another discussion with my manager and try to better understand his feedback and judgement. I would not be afraid to voice my own opinions. I would resolve to work even harder.,I would find this experience boring and would not volunteer to be involved in the project. I do not think I would have much to gain. Learning more about Norway's culture and history would not benefit me anyway except with this one client. I believe my time could be better spent in other ways.
10460279012,"I would try speaking to my colleague about his/her refusal to attempt a compromise, maybe that person has some type of important event to attend. If no compromise was reached for qhatever reason, I would be obligated to change my plans so as not to miss work.","I would go ahead and get the project done and out of the way as quickly as possible.  That way, if the boss tosses me a last minute task, I'm free....and if he doesnt, I'm still free! I dont like putting things off til the last minute anyway.","I would have no choice but to meet my client, because that's my responsibility as an employee.","I would find out exactly what the issue was and do everything in my power to fix it. I dont like/want animosity in the workplace, not would I want to lose my bonus.","I honestly dont know what I would do. If I knew a bit more about Norway, I could answer this a bit better, but I dont. Another thing, there are too many variables and not enough info to answer. I can, without a doubt, say this much though....if my baby were still small, this wouldn't even be debatable because I'd be home"
10462919856,"I would adjust my vacation plans.  I typically plan far enough in advance that my vacations can be flexible.  I get along well with my co-workers, and I think this would be a sign of good faith with them.  I might tell them that they owe me a beer.","I would work hard to get the majority of the task finished in advance.  I might not actually complete the entire thing too far ahead of schedule, because that would be inviting more work to fall on me.  However, if I complete enough that I can relax, then I'll be able to handle additional tasks if they do come my way.","I would skip the event as well.  I'm not particularly good at networking, so if I don't have my colleague there to help grease the wheels I probably wouldn't be very effective.  If it's not a mandatory meeting, I'd be content missing it.","I would approach my manager with my response to his feedback.  If I can really justify why I don't think it's accurate feedback, I would have no problem communicating my concerns in a respectful manner.  It might not change his mind in the end, but it would at least send a message that I won't be bulldozed.","I would enjoy learning more about Norway for this project.  I love travel, so my preference would be to put my knowledge to use with an actual trip.  However, I think I would still be engaged in the process just because it feels similar to traveling.  I would feel connected."
10459825133,I would change my vacation plans if I was able to rearrange the dates and if my husband was able to take off the same dates. If I wasn't able to rearrange the dates and I couldnt get my money back I would reason with the boss.,I would probably wait until the last minute to do the project. That's just my nature and I get more done under pressure. It usually works out okay.,I would definitely not go. I'm not going to go to something where I don't know anyone. I'm anxious enough in situations like that as it is. No need to make it worse.,"I would go to the managers supervisor and tell them what's going on, as well as request a meeting with my manager and her supervisor to discuss the issues.","I would volunteer to do the project. It sounds like it would be fun, and it would be a good opportunity to learn something new. Anytime you gain insight into another culture is a good thing."
10459708204,To me it would depend on who put in their request first. So I would ask my supervisor to base the decision on who requested time off first. If it was them then I'd have no problem then taking vacation time if it was me then I would insist on taking the vacation time.,I would start working on the project immediately especially if I'm not that swamped and busy at work. That way if something else comes up or my boss gives me extra work at the last minute. I don't have to worry about feeling overloaded and overwhelmed. I don't put off for tomorrow what i can do today.,I would really try my hardest to persuade my friend and colleague to go. But if they chose not to I would be kind of bummed but I would still go. Whether I know someone or not the fact that one of my biggest client is involved makes that an important priority.,I would feel really bad and it would not be a pleasant feeling. But I also don't want to lose my bonus or possibly have that happened. So I would ask my boss what areas did they think that I could improve in and I would work on those areas really hard put my focus on doing my best. Then when my annual bonus time came if I got a bonus but I felt was fair i would have no problem if I didn't get my annual bonus and I know I did my best to improve I would look for other employment.,I would find the experience enjoyable and exciting. Because I've never been to Norway before and I like going new places. As well as meeting new people and trying out new things.
10462857786,I wouldn't change my plans. I already have plans and they can't be changed. Somehow my colleague will have to change their's. I've made my plans a long time ago,I would work as hard as I could on this. I would do my best to complete it in the time frame stated. If I work hard enough I can accomplish this.,I would say I wasn't going if they weren't going. I would be uncomfortable going alone. I would make an excuse not to go,I would be very upset. I would most likely ask my manager why I received the feedback that I received. I would definitely not just let it go.,I would find this boring. It's not something that I'm interested in. I would definitely not volunteer for the experience.
10459674145,I would discuss with my boss the companies policy and procedure for this situation. I would evaluate my specific needs for this time as well as my coworkers. At the end of the day I’d feel it’s my bosses problem.,I would spend as much free time as possible working on my big project now. This would allow me to do any other tasks my boss gives me during that time period. I would hope to have everything finished.,I would attend the outing. I would hope I’d make friends easily. I think this would be beneficial to my future,I would be very upset about the situation. I would ask my boss for more feedback explaining their rationales. I would not sign the evaluation and state in writing my thoughts.,I would not find this expierence enjoyable. I have no interest in Norway. I think it would be boring.
10459731727,I would try to find out whom put their vacation request time in first. The person who put their's in last would need to reschedule their vacation.,I would work on the project since the workload is light until it is completed. If my boss gives me additional tasks I won't have to worry about completing the project since it will be done already.,I would go. The networking meeting is a great place to meet new people and hopefully get new business or possibly a new job.,I would plead my case to my manager and try to find out why they are giving me the negative feedback. I would be prepared with proof that what he/she was saying was incorrect.,I would find the experience enjoyable. It is always fund to learn new things about a different country and the culture of that country.
10460095413,"I would avoid doing anything. It's likely I put my vacation in first so I should get it. Worst case scenario is having management just deciding on who gets the week off. In most cases it'll go by seniority or position and if those are equal, simply whoever put it in first gets it. This way I don't have to deal with them being stubborn and I make someone else the bad guy.","I would plan out how long it would take for me to complete it under varying conditions. If I can get it done in a week with no interruptions then I'm safe. I can also dedicate time to helping other workers with their projects, in case I get a heavy workload from my boss, I can likely call in a favor from at least one person.","I would tell my colleague that it's fine if only I go. I'd simply remind them that in the future they'll likely have to go in my place and that I wouldn't mind getting all the credit from whatever happens at the meeting. If they then go with me, I now am no longer alone and if they don't I can avoid a future meeting I don't want to go to.","I would tell the truth as I am not afraid. If I can prove they're wrong and try to embarrass them by using whatever I've done as leverage. If I've interacted with their boss or someone they work along side, I can also use this to my benefit. I just have to make it seem as though whatever they said was the issue was, in fact, beneficial to them.",I would find it boring. It's basically a baby sitting job for me that likely won't involve extra pay. I'd probably just try to get it over with or make someone else responsible.
10459955025,"If my colleague was not willing to change their vacation plans, i would figure out if changing my vacation plans is doable. If it is, i would go ahead and change it. I would prefer being the bigger person rather than creating a fuss.","I would complete the project the earliest possible to ensure. Doing this would ensure i don't run out of time in the long run, due to the inconsistent work load. The more i have done soon, the less i have to worry.","i would try to convince my colleague to go. If he is not budging, then i would go on my own. I wouldn't want to depend on my colleague.","I would feel horrible about this situation. I would attempt to have a conversation with my manager to see if i can convince my manager that they were incorrect. If i do have consequences that i believe are unfair, i'd find another job.",I would find this enjoyable. Being able to learn about norway would be interesting. I don't mind not having to travel.
10460413642,"I would start by finding out if they have plans that cannot be canceled. If they have plane tickets/hotels or the such that can't be canceled without a huge penalty, I would probably be willing to compromise. If I wasn't doing anything particular that week, I would probably be willing to change mine anyway. I would also want my supervisor to guarantee I get my next requested vacation time approved if I cancel mine now.","I would complete my project with plenty of time to spare. I like to plan in advance and have things completed early anyway. If I know that at the last minute he is probably going to have other tasks for me, I will plan accordingly. I would make sure that I have as much possible completed in the first week so that I will still have time for anything else that they can throw at me.","I would attempt to find someone to go with me. I don't particularly enjoy meetings like this, and I don't really enjoy being alone in these situations. Failing being able to find someone else to go, I would probably try to convince my colleague to come anyway or see if we could reschedule to a time that they would be able to come.","I would talk to my manager as the very first thing. I would ask for additional feedback as to why they gave me the feedback, and then would give my side of the argument. I would ask what I could do to change the situation so that it doesn't affect anything else, such as my bonus. I wouldn't just let it slide, I would definitely gather my evidence of the disagreement and talk to them about it.","I would find this pretty enjoyable. It would be great to learn some new things about another country and culture. Plus, if travel does end up being needed, it would be nice to know ahead of time what to expect. As well, it would be good for the deal to have a closer bond to the client. I would definitely volunteer and find it enjoyable."
10460105559,"I would ask my supervisor that since I am not going to push the issue, that I would like to have my future vacations guaranteed.  In fact, I would like to submit them now.","I would get this project done and over with.  If I put this off till the last day, my boss is more than likely going to have me do something that would prevent me from getting the project done on time.","I would go anyways.  i am there to network, not make friends.  Besides, I am a socialable person, it's easy for me to strike up a conversation.","I would go up the chain of command and make my case.  I would back it up with facts, if possible.  I take my annual bonuses serious!",I would like it.  Norway is a pretty cool country and I wouldn't mind doing something different.
10440097909,"I would see if I was able to change my vacation plans. If I would be able to accommodate her schedule, I would try to do so or maybe strike some deal if I am sacrificing so that she is able to do what she likes. I would be frustrated but think that there is probably a way to resolve this to make everyone moderately happy.",I would begin by working on the project as soon as possible. That way I could accommodate any last minute requests from my boss and be able to get the project completed on time. I would try to manage my time in the coming weeks so that nothing would surprise me.,I would stop in for a little bit. It seems like it would be an important event and it would be necessary for me to show my face. I don't think I would stay long but I think it would set me apart from my colleague in an important way.,I would see if I could talk to anyone else regarding this feedback. I would see if there was someone higher up or a colleague who could vouch for the feedback being untrue. I would also see if I could speak to the manager and see why the feedback was given.,I would find this experience enjoyable. I wouldn't have to leave home but I would be immersed within a new culture and have motivation/compensation for learning about something new. I think this would be fun and fulfilling.
